China's Xi, in restive west, cites medieval Japanese raiders: report | GlobalPost
Chinese President Xi Jinping made a two-day visit to the country's restive western region from Sunday, instructing local police combating "terrorists" to learn from historical campaigns against marauders, mostly from Japan, who plundered China's coastal areas centuries ago, a media report said.
The remark follows the top Chinese leader's speech critical of Japan in Berlin in March. Xi said Japanese troops killed more than 300,000 Chinese in the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, a figure painting a far bleaker picture of the atrocity than Japanese estimates.
At a police station in Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Xi said looking at long police batons reminded him of how the army of the 16th century military general Qi Jiguang of the Ming Dynasty fought off pirates, according to the report.
Xi was quoted as saying that a group of five to seven soldiers kept off the raiders with bamboo spears before soldiers with shields attacked and killed them. He added today's Chinese must also have superior fighting methods and weapons.
At a Friday meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, Xi pledged to resolutely contain "terrorism."
Kashgar is located in the westernmost part of China and has seen a number of people believed to be ethnic Uyghurs shot and killed by security forces for "acts of violence" in recent months.
