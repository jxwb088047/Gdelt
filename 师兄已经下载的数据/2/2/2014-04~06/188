China pronounces 55 guilty in Xinjiang stadium | The Indian Express
Court officials in China’s restive northwestern region of Xinjiang have pronounced 55 people guilty of murder, separatism and terrorist offenses in a stadium before an audience of 7,000 people.
The official Xinhua News Agency said the verdicts were delivered on Tuesday in Yili, a prefecture in northern Xinjiang. It said the audience was made up of local residents and officials.
The announcement comes a week after a bombing in Xinjiang killed dozens of people.
Xinhua said officials of the Yili branch of the Xinjiang High Court also announced the arrests and detentions of another 65 people for offenses including separatism.
The report gave few details about the offenses, but the names mentioned all appeared to be members of Xinjiang’s Uighur ethnic minority.
