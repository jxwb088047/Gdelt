Uighur scholar kept in chains in China, lawyer says | World | Reuters
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities held a prominent Uighur academic in leg irons for 20 days and forced him to go without food, his lawyer said on Thursday, after seeing his client for the first time since he was arrested more than five months ago.
Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University who has championed the rights of the Muslim Uighur people in China's far western region of Xinjiang, was detained in January and subsequently charged with separatism.
His case has attracted high-level concern in the United States and European Union and is seen by rights groups as part of China's crackdown on dissent in Xinjiang. There are deep tensions between indigenous ethnic groups and majority Han Chinese immigrants in the region, and sporadic outbreaks of violence.
Tohti's lawyer, Li Fangping, said his client, despite being placed in leg irons for 20 days, maintained his innocence after months of incommunicado detention.
"Because he eats halal food there was a dispute. He went on a hunger strike for 10 days in January," Li told Reuters by telephone from Xinjiang where Tohti is being held.
After a deadly attack at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming in March, which the government blamed on separatist militants from Xinjiang, authorities denied Tohti food for another eight days.
"For eight days he didn't eat anything.Â He lost 16 kilograms. On the tenth day he was given a bun. Restricting his food constitutes a form of abuse," Li said, adding that he had worries about Tohti's physical condition and that his state of mind was "very anxious".
"He is very persistent. He has always maintained his innocence," Li said.
