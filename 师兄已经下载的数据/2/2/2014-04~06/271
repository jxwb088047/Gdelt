Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered a crackdown after a stabbing spree and explosion at a railway station in the restive Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang left three people dead and 79 wounded, state media said Thursday.The violence came as Xi was wrapping up what state media characterised as an "inspection tour" of the volatile region in China's far west, during which he had called for a "strike-first" strategy to fight terrorism.Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for exile group the World Uyghur Congress, citing local sources, claimed more than 100 Uighurs were arrested in the aftermath of Wednesday's attack.Xinjiang is a vast and nominally autonomous region where Uighurs are the largest ethnic group, though decades of migration to the area by China's dominant Han majority has fostered tensions.It was unclear if Xi was still in Xinjiang when the attack occurred.State television footage on Thursday morning showed Xi, clad in a black work jacket favoured by China's top leaders, meeting with law enforcement officials, ordinary residents and school children during his visit.
