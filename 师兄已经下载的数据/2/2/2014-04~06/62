13 May 2014 - Armed police patrols deployed in Beijing - News - My Sinchew
BEIJING, May 12 (Bernama) –- China has deployed a total of 150 armoured police patrol vehicles in Beijing on Monday, following several attacks in the country.
Their main task is to tackle incidents involving guns, bombs, mass violence or terrorism, Xinhua news agency quoted sources from the Beijing Public Security Bureau as saying.
It said the armoured vehicles would be stationed at main intersections with heavy traffic, particularly the main streets of Beijing, with nine policemen and four assistants in each vehicle.
"Each vehicle will cover an area less than 3km. The police are required to respond within three minutes after receiving a report," said Xinhua.
The move was initiated in the wake of several recent violent terror attacks at railway stations. China has blamed Uyghur extremists - a Muslim minority from China's far western region of Xinjiang province - for the attacks.
On April 30, a 'suicide□bombing and knife attack' occurred at a train station in Urumqi, regional capital of northwest China's Xinjiang, which left three people dead and 79 others wounded.
On March 1, a total of 33 people were stabbed to death while 130 others sustained head and body injuries in a bloody knife attack at the Kunming railway station, southwestern China.
On Oct 28, last year, a suicide attack at Tiananmen Square, the□heart of Beijing left five people killed and dozens injured after a car crashed into the crowd.
