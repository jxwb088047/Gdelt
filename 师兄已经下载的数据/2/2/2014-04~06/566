Thirteen people have been executed in western China for involvement in terrorist activities.
Chinese television has shown convicted men being put into the back of prison vans and driven through the streets on their way to execution.
According to Xinhua wire service, 13 executions have been carried out this week in far-Western Xinjiang.
Officials say those killed were members of so-called "terrorist groups".
Their specific crimes reportedly ranged from storing explosives and attacking police stations to arson and theft.
China is in the midst of a major crackdown on ethnic-Uighur separatists following an escalation of bloody attacks on train stations and public spaces in recent months.
