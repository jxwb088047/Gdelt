Crackdown Launched in Restive Xinjiang Village After Fatal Police Shooting
Chinese authorities have launched a crackdown on a village in the Xinjiang region where an ethnic minority Uyghur teen motorcyclist was shot dead by police after he ran a red light, detaining more than 50 people who had publicly protested against the killing, according to family members. They also expressed concern that three key eyewitnesses of the April 12 shooting death of high school dropout Abdulbasit Ablimit, 17, in Kelpin county in Aksu prefecture have disappeared and are believed to have been taken into police custody, and that the authorities have swiftly buried Ablimit in a secret location and refused to inform the family about the burial site for prayers. “In the last two weeks or so, the authorities have detained more than 50 relatives and other villagers and accused them of being main participants of a protest” questioning the circumstances in which Ablimit died, his mother Aminem told RFA’s Uyghur Service. Up to 500 Uyghurs had marched, carrying Ablimit's body, to the county office to protest the police shooting, demanding that the authorities take action against those who had fired at him. Chinese state media have claimed that Ablimit was shot after he sped past two consecutive security checkpoints and clashed with police officers, but friends who were with him on the day of the incident debunked the claim.    “They detained several people every day. I heard that some of them were taken to the Aksu city detention center,” Aminem said, lamenting that she could not even organize prayers for her dead son because “all of our relatives have been detained and there are very few men left in our village now.” Ruling Chinese Communist party propaganda groups from Kelpin county and Aksu prefecture have also been going to Qum’eriq village “every day” to constantly monitor the situation, she said. Ablimit's friends had told RFA that he and several others were traveling on separate motorcycles after visiting another friend at the Kelpin county bazaar when police fired at him about three kilometers (nearly two miles) after he whizzed past a red traffic light.
