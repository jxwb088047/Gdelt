Instigation is the terror of terrors - People's Daily Online
A Wednesday evening terrorist attack in Xinjiang warns Chinese that anti-terrorism is a long-term campaign while instigators might be away from the home field.Three people were confirmed dead and 79 others were injured in a violent attack at a railway station in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Wednesday evening.At the moment, it is acknowledged to be a terrorist attack. What is yet to find out is who did this for what purpose under whose instigation.But someone could not wait anymore. Hours after the terrorist attack, Dilxat Raxit, spokesman of the so-called World Uygur Congress based in Germany, was quoted by the media that "such incidents could happen again at any time."Could he be more licentious by being not even bothered to gloss over his bloodlust? Anyone who preaches killing one's own kind is a murder.The threshold between violence and innocence cannot be clearer, even if seen from a child's eyes. To confound terrorism with innocence is a sheer action of connivance, if not instigation, before investigation concludes.It is the government's obligation to protect its people against terrorism. Whoever commits must be punished according to law regardless to his or her position or background.Terrorism in any form, with any excuse, for any purpose, by anyone should be condemned and struck without hesitation instead of being tolerated and even incited.It has been a common sense that any violence targeted at civilians is a crime against humanity, and therefore must be cracked down and punished.Dilxat Raxit attempted to throw dust into people's eyes before the police investigation result is announced.He claimed he was worrying about the situation of the Uygur people in Xinjiang following the terrorist attack. But that makes him sound more like a racist who seeks to sow dissension among ethnic groups and stigmatizes with intention a certain ethnic group he claims to represent.Why? It's time to disclose the dark scheme behind which he and his organization conspire.
