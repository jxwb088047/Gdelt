The latest attack took place on May 20 at an open air market in the regional capital Urumqi. The attack killed 39 people and injured 94 others. Xi identified a series of measures to ease religious tensions. He advocated protecting local customs and legal religious activities, cracking down on those that are illegal and extreme, and guarding against infiltration.
