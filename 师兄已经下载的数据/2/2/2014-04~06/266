Like India, China too concerned over Taliban, Al-Qaeda return in
Like India, China has also reportedly expressed its concern over the Taliban and Al-Qaeda regaining control over most parts of Afghanistan, after NATO troops exit from the war-torn nation at the end of this year.

Beijing is said to have voiced and flagged this concern with India during their sixth annual strategic dialogue at the level of foreign secretaries earlier this week.

The Chinese Government, according to a report in the Daily Excelsior, worried about the emergence of the Taliban and Al Qaeda having a destabilising effect on China's Muslim-dominant Uygur Xinjiang Province, which has suffered from a series of terror attacks in recent times.

Both sides are reported to have discussed their mutual concerns over Afghanistan's stability in the backdrop of plans by the United States and NATO to withdraw their troops from there.

Both sides are said to have recommitted to consolidating strategic bilateral ties based on mutual trust as well as sensitiveness to each other's concerns and aspirations.

The Indian delegation was led by Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, while the Chinese side was led by the country's Vice Foreign Minister Lui Zhenmin. (ANI)
