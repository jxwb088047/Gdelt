China: 32 terror groups broken up - Longview News-Journal - Longview, TX
BEIJING - Chinese authorities said Monday they broke up 32 terror groups and arrested more than 380 suspects in the far west in the first month of a crackdown aimed at demonstrating the Communist Party's resolve to maintain order in a borderland hit by recent unrest. Many suspects received rapid trials and stiff sentences, including death penalties.
Security forces also seized several hundred explosive devices, a few tons of explosive material and computers and books about terrorism and religious extremism, officials from the Xinjiang region told reporters.
