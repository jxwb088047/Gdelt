Chinese police shoot dead 13 attackers in restive Xinjiang
URUMQI: Thirteen mobsters were killed and three policemen were injured Saturday morning in an attack on a police station in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the local government said. No civilians were hurt, according to the regional information office. The gangsters drove a truck to ram the building of the public security bureau of Yecheng County in southern Xinjiang and set off explosives. Police shot and killed 13 attackers at the scene. Three policemen were slightly injured. Public security authorities are investigating the incident and local social order is normal. Xinjiang is a remote region with more than half of its population ethnic minorities who hold Muslim beliefs. Violent attacks in the name of “jihad” have been increasing since 2009 and are the biggest threat to the region, according to the regional public security department. Yecheng in the region’s Kashgar Prefecture is more than 1,500 kilometers southwest of the regional capital of Urumqi. Xinjiang has stepped up anti-terrorism efforts following terrorist attacks on train stations in Kunming of Yunnan Province and Urumqi in the first half of this year.
