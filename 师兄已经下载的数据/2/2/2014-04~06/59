Uighur group granted access to Turkey after 18-day wait | General | Worldbulletin News
35 Uighur Turks who have been kept waiting in transit at Istanbul Ataturk airport since fleeing to Turkey from China on March 25 have finally been given permission to enter the country.
The group, which included women and children, had arrived in Turkey with different flights in an attempt to escape persecution in their homeland of East Turkestan (Xinjiang), China.
Concerns were being raised over their health during their lengthy wait amid reports that one child had been rushed to hospital.
Due to missing documents, the group was not legally entitled to enter Turkey. However, after fulfilling the necessary checks, the group was finally granted entry.
