Chinese police shoot dead 13 attackers | TheCelebrityCafe.com
Police in Xinjiang China shot dead 13 assailants as they set off explosives in an attack Saturday morning.
According to the Associated Press, the men drove a vehicle into a police office building and proceeded to attack with explosives.
Officials have pointed the attacks to the natives of the Xinjiang region, the Uighur people.
The Uighurs are native Muslim people that want to overthrow Beijing’s rule.
According to BBC News, activists of the group accuse the central government’s policies of restricting their cultural and religious activities.
This is not the first time terrorists attacks have been pointed to the native group.
At least 31 people were killed last month in a market bombing in China’s Xinjiang region.
According to The Guardian, the blasts took place at an open market in the morning in the city of Urumqi.
The assailants drove two vehicles threw the crowded market place and threw explosives from the windows.
Five people were killed last year when three men, suspected to be Uighurs, drove their car into a crowd of people, BBC News reported.
Earlier this month, China recently executed 13 people for terroristic crimes in Xinjiang.
They were believed to be a part of the Uighur native group.
