Xinjiang police busted 23 terror, extremist groups in May: Xinhua | TODAYonline
BEIJING — Chinese police in the far western region of Xinjiang have taken down 23 “terror and religious extremism groups” and caught more than 200 suspects in May, state media said, days after the region’s deadliest attack in years.
China has announced year-long “anti-terrorism” operations in restive Xinjiang, home to a large Muslim Uighur minority, as well as nationwide, following a series of bloody incidents that Beijing blames on Islamists and separatists from the region.
Police busted the groups in the southern Xinjiang prefectures of Hotan, Kashgar and Aksu and seized more than 200 explosive devices in raids, the official Xinhua news agency said late on Sunday.
Many of those captured were in their 20s and 30s, and had learnt how to make explosives by watching online videos, Xinhua said.
It was the first announcement of a large number of arrests since an attack last week in the region’s capital killed at least 31 that police have blamed on a “terrorist gang”. AGENCIES
