Urumqi terrorist attack despicable, outrageous: Fijian PM | GlobalPost
SUVA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has extended Fiji's condolences to China over the violent terrorist attack in Urumqi in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, denouncing the attack as "despicable" and " outrageous", the Fijian government announced Saturday.
In a note to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Bainimarama said the Fijian people stand with the people of China in their moment of grief, according to Fiji's Ministry of Information.
"We are deeply saddened to hear of the tragic loss of life and those that were injured from this despicable and outrageous act of violence against innocent civilians," Bainimarama said, "The warm and strong friendship between our two nations only strengthens our resolve to stand with the people of China as they overcome this terror event."
At this time of grief and mourning, the thoughts of those who passed away weigh heavily in the hearts of Fijians, said the Fijian head of government.
"Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with the families of the victims and all the people of the People's Republic of China," said Bainimarama.
A terrorist bombing attack occurred at an open air market in Urumqi, capital of far west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on Thursday, leaving 39 people dead and 94 others injured.
