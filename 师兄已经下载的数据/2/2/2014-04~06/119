U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power Just Beat a Buzzfeed Reporter at His Own Game | Foreign Policy
On Wednesday, BuzzFeed reporter Andrew Kaczynski took a swipe at politicians’ Twitter presence, but Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, didn’t take the snark sitting down:
.@BuzzFeedAndrew Guilty as charged! Worse than tweeting like a #BuzzFeedReporter tho? "52 ways to know you work @ BuzzFeed. AND 6 cat pics!"
Forgoing a more Buzzfeed-style response — "25 Sad Cats Who Got Burned on Twitter by an Ambassador" perhaps? — Kaczynski quickly conceded defeat:
Before she went into government, Power was an accomplished journalist and a regular contributor to the New Yorker. She cut her teeth covering the violence in the Balkans during the 1990s and picked up a Pulitzer for her book, A Problem from Hell, which chronicles American inaction in the face of genocide.
Presumably, she has a slightly more high-minded view of what journalism ought to be than BuzzFeed’s cat listicles.
