PRESS DIGEST- China - April 29 | Reuters
April 29 Chinese newspapers available in Beijing
and Shanghai carried the following stories on Tuesday. Reuters
has not checked the stories and does not vouch for their
accuracy.
- The pace of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)
in resuming IPO applications will not overly speed up despite
the commission's recent spate of "pre-disclosure" of companies
waiting to be listed, with sources expecting four to five
companies to be granted per week in the near term. As of April
28, up to 144 companies have submitted the draft version of
prospectuses, the CSRC information disclosure shows.
- Members of the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA)
have lost 2.329 billion yuan ($372.5 million) in the first
quarter of 2014, with 45.45 percent of the association members
losing money because of low demand, high inventory stock and
declining price.
- A total of 2453 A-share listed companies have released
their 2013 annual reports so far, with the sum of their net
profit reaching 2,240 billion yuan, a 15 percent rise
year-on-year.
- In spite of high rates, the number of China's new issuance
of quasi-municipal bonds in 2014 has reached 215 so far this
year, raising 248.31 billion yuan, a 36.28 percent increase from
the same time of last year.
- Chinese stocks saw a sharp drop on Monday after the
securities regulator said it will resume reviewing IPO
applications following an 18-month moratorium. The Shanghai
Composite Index lost 1.6 percent before closing at 2003.49, the
Shenzhen Component Index dropped 1.14 percent to 7240.46.
- China's president Xi Jinping visited armed policeman,
local residents' homes and a primary school after arriving in
the restive Xinjiang autonomous region on Sunday, encouraging
local officials to promote harmony among all ethnic groups.
- Higher quality as well as wider coverage of road
constructing in China's rural areas must be achieved to fulfil
the goal of modern agriculture, an editorial said, commenting on
president Xi Jinping's series of conduct highlighting the
significance in rural transportation infrastructure.
