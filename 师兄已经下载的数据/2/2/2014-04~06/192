 Two off-road vehicles ploughed into people in the regional capital, Urumqi, and unidentified assailants threw explosives, Xinhua reported.

 The cars then crashed head-on and one exploded. The authorities did not identify the suspects.

 It was not clear who was behind the violence, but the authorities have blamed a series of attacks in public places in recent weeks on ethnic-Uygur separatists from Xinjiang.

 Yesterday's incident in North Gongyuan Street was the bloodiest single act of violence in the restive Northwestern region since about 200 people were killed in clashes in Urumqi in 2009 between Uygurs and ethnic Han Chinese.

 The Ministry of Public Security described it as a "serious violent terrorist incident". And President Xi Jinping called for those behind the incident to be severely punished.

 The injured were sent to hospitals for treatment and the scene was sealed off for several hours. Photographs posted on social media showed injured people on the ground, with clothes and other items strewn across the street.

 A bomb and knife attack at the end of last month at the main railway station in Urumqi killed one bystander and wounded 79 people. Two attackers also died.
