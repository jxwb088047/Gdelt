Scientists to Investigate Xinjiang's Lop Nor Lake Dry-Out - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
The Chinese Academy of Science will launch an investigation into the Lop Nur lake in norwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region later this year, Xinhua reports on Sunday.
Lop Nur was the largest lake in northwest China until it dried up in 1972. The lake nourished the ancient kingdom of Loulan on its western banks.
Nearly 50 researchers will conduct at least three large-scale field surveys in the next five years.
Sampling will help unveil the mystery of the disappearance of the Loulan kingdom and explore the development of the ecological environment of Lop Nur.
