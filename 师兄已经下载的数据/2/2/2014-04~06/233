BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC) will carry a commentary on Monday, calling for governing Xinjiang with a strategic and overall perspective.
The People's Daily said in the commentary that Xi's speech in the second central work conference on northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region should be carried out resolutely as it was with rich contents and strategic farsight.
Xi stressed long-term stability as the main goal for the region in the two-day conference closed on Thursday, which was held in the wake of a series of bloody terrorist attacks in the region, including one in an open air market in Urumqi, the region's capital, which left 39 people dead and 94 injured on May 20.
