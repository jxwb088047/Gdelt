China has also been gradually phasing out the use of the Uighur language in education, throwing Uighur teachers out of work and adding to concerns that Uighur culture is under siege.There is also a large network of activists in the Uighur diaspora who call for a peaceful struggle against the authorities. They are led by U.S.-based Rebiya Kadeer, whom China imprisoned, then exiled and now accuses of stirring ethnic riots in Xinjiang that left almost 200 people dead in 2009 . HAS CHINA RESPONDED?Beijing rules Xinjiang with an iron fist and has ignored Uighur demands and even calls from within the Chinese political system to reconsider some of its most restrictive policies.WHO ARE THE UIGHURS?The Uighurs are Central Asian people who are ethnically, culturally, linguistically and religiously distinct from Han Chinese.
