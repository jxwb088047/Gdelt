This case is weird. Turkey is a modern nation, on the cusp of getting on the path to EU membership. If these people were turkish nationals they wouldn't need to use people smugglers to go to a country like Thailand. Especially not in order to go to their own country. They might be ethnically turkic, but there are many people that are in Asia.
They want to go to Turkey. Turkey wants them. Case closed for Thailand. Why kowtow before China.
If those people do not consider themselves chinese , if china wants to kill/maim those people why give them to china? Thai government should avoid staining their hand with innocent refugee blood. Let them go to Turkey or other country
