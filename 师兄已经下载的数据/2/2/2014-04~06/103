China's Xinjiang offers rewards for turning in guns, explosives | GlobalPost
URUMQI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Police in China's far-western Xinjiang region have offered rewards for citizens who turn over guns, explosives or provide tips on these items.
Residents will be rewarded 500 yuan for each military rifle, 300 yuan for each gun for civilian use, and five yuan for each bullet they hand over, said a document issued by the Public Security Department of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
As for explosives, individuals will be given 100 yuan for turning over a grenade, landmine or source bomb, 30 yuan for a detonator, 20 yuan for each kg of dynamite and 10 yuan for each kg of gunpowder, said the reward document, which took effect on Tuesday.
Those who hand in long knives not for food preparation or personal use and imitation guns will be rewarded according to their market value, it added.
Citizens who provide tips on specific large amounts of explosives, guns and knives will also be given rewards of up to 10,000 yuan.
Those whose tips play an especially important role in preventing or breaking up an explosives-related terrorist case will be rewarded between 5,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan.
Xinjiang launched a special campaign on May 23 to crack down on violent terrorist crimes after an open market attack in the capital Urumqi left 39 innocent people dead and more than 90 injured in the deadliest terrorist attack in the region in recent years.
