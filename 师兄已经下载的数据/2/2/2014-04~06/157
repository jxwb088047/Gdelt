Attackers Severely Kill 31 Civilians in China’s Xinjiang
At least 31 people were killed on Thursday when attackers ploughed two vehicles into a market and threw explosives in the capital of China's Xinjiang region.
Chinese authorities called the attack "the latest severe terrorist incident" to hit the Muslim Uighur homeland.   More than 90 people were also wounded when two off-road vehicles drove into a crowd in Urumqi, with one of them exploding, the regional government's Tianshan web portal said, in an attack with echoes of a fiery car crash in Tiananmen Square last year.   Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to "severely punish terrorists and spare no efforts in maintaining stability", the official Xinhua news agency reported.
China has seen a series of attacks in recent months targeting civilians that authorities have blamed on separatists from Xinjiang.
