Following the serial violent attacks in public in the past two months, Meng Jianzhu, head of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee, has said that that law enforcement agencies and judicial departments will now deploy new technologies to detect and remove security threats. As part of the new measures, Chinese Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun and Vice Ministers of Public Security Fu Zhenghua and Liu Yanping visited different railway stations Tuesday night to inspect security there. On Tuesday morning, a male suspect carrying a knife attacked people at a railway station in the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou. The motive behind the attack is yet to be determined. In another attack on April the 30th, three people were killed and 79 wounded at a railway station in Urumqi, capital of northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. And on March the 1st, assailants killed 29 civilians and wounded another 143, at a railway station in the southwestern city of Kunming. The last two incidents were confirmed as terrorist attacks.
