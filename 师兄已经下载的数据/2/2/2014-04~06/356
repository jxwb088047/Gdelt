Police in China's troubled north-west region of Xinjiang have broken up 23 terror or extremist groups and detained more than 200 suspected militants in the last month, state media have reported.
A report in The Guardian notes that the news came as authorities said a year-long anti-terrorism crackdown would require 'unconventional measures', and the region's party chief, Zhang Chunxian, announced a 'people's war' against terrorism, following one of the most deadly attacks in years. Forty-three people were killed and more than 90 injured in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, last Thursday when attackers in two off-road vehicles drove through a street market throwing explosives. Officials say four of the assailants died at the scene and a fifth was captured later that night. The attack was the latest in a string of incidents, and has led experts to warn of a mounting terrorist threat originating in the region. The Ministry of Public Security said police 'should only target terrorists and religious extremists and protect the legal rights and interests of ethnic minority people'. Maya Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said: '(It is) important that the criminal process, from arrest to imprisonment, is conducted in ways that ensure they catch the right people and that there is due process.'
