President Xi Pays Home Visit in Xinjiang - All China Women's Federation
President Xi Jinping paid a home visit to Abudukeyoumu Rouzi, a villager in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on April 28, to see whether the Party's policies are welcomed and effective.
At Rouzi's home, Xi looked around his living room, courtyard, kitchen, sheepfold, orchard and at his farming tools.
Party policies must be centered on people's opinions and livelihood, said Xi, adding his visit was to see if these policies had attained their goals.
During the visit, the villagers who came to Rouzi's home were talkative and a folk artist played music on the traditional Uyghur musical instrument aijike, including the song Our Xinjiang is the Most Beautiful. .
"We need to strengthen national unity and build a better Xinjiang. I hope everyone's life is like what the music described," said Xi.
