Live Call-in with Expert on Urumqi Market Attack
Chinese President Xi Jinping is vowing to severely punish those responsible for this morning's terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.
He says police in Urumqi are going to be stepping up their security control over possible terrorist targets to prevent ripple effects.
Terrorists drove two vehicles into a crowd of people in a public square in Urumqi this morning, throwing out explosive devices as they plowed through the crowds before blowing up their vehicles.
The attack has left 31 dead and over 90 injured.
Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun has been dispatched to Xinjiang to oversee the investigation.
The attack comes on the heels of a pronouncement on Wednesday by judicial authorities in Xinjiang that they've prosecuted nearly 40-people since the end of March for terrorist-related activities in the region.
For more on this, we spoke earlier this evening with Shen Dingli, Vice Dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai.
