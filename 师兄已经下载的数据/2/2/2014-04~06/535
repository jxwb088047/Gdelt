Friends of Dead Uyghur Teen Reject Government Claims He Attacked Police
Friends of an ethnic minority Uyghur teen motorcyclist who was shot dead a week ago by Chinese police after he ran a red light in the Xinjiang region have rejected government claims that he had tried to attack a police officer after he sped past two security checkpoints. High school dropout Abdulbasit Ablimit, 17, died on the spot while two of his passenger friends were wounded after being shot from behind by policemen who went after them for the traffic violation in Kelpin county in Aksu prefecture on April 12, RFA had reported, quoting sources.The violent police action triggered a public fury, with up to 500 Uyghurs marching and carrying Ablimit's body to the county office and demanding that the authorities explain the circumstances that led to the shooting and calling for action against the policeman who killed Ablimit, the sources had said.Chinese state media however claimed on April 17 that Ablimit was shot after he sped past two consecutive security checkpoints and clashed with police officers. The Tianshan web portal run by the government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region claimed a police officer "fired warning shots into the air,” after which Ablimit "assailed the officer and seized his firearm,” citing Aksu police. It did not say how the teenager was injured.The Aksu government called Ablimit a "terrorist" on its website. Returning home
