China launches drive against extremist internet content - Newspaper - DAWN.COM
BEIJING: China announ­ced a crackdown on Friday on internet content promoting terrorism and violence that has been blamed for inspiring a recent string of deadly attacks by extremists seeking independence for the north-eastern region of Xinjiang.
The launch of the campaign comes just over two weeks before the fifth anniversary of the riots between members of the Xinjiang’s native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group and migrants from elsewhere in China that left nearly 200 dead.
It follows a wider crackdown on extremist crime in response to increasingly bold and well-planned atta­cks in Xinjiang and elsewhere that have killed at least 63 people this year.
The official Xinhua News Agency said police would sc­­our the web for material pr­o­moting jihad or teaching bomb-making techniques and other methods of violence.
It said filtering would be strengthened and webmasters ordered to police their sites or face being punished.
Xinhua said virtually all those taking part in recent attacks had been exposed to extremist content. It said Xinjiang separatists had recently flooded the web with such material, raising the challenge to authorities and the risk of further attacks.
“Terror video and audio products have become a major instigator of the high incidence of terrorist activities at present,” Xinhua said, quoting a statement from the government’s State Internet Information Office.
It said the office had offered rewards of up to 100,000 yuan ($16,055) for information on the dissemination of such material.—AP
