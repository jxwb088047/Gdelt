Uighur Turks stranded at Istanbul airport for 17 days | General | Worldbulletin News
35 Uighur Turks who fled from persecution in China to Turkey have been waiting desperately at Istanbul Ataturk airport for days to get permission to enter the country.
The group, which contains women and children, arrived on March 25 on various flights and have been waiting ever since.
Having been unable to wash and eat properly for 17 days, a local firm called TAV has offered to feed them while they get the necessary paperwork out the way.
Worries are now growing for their health as it is believed they are beginning to develop illnesses.
Reports say that one child has already been taken to hospital.
There are an increasing number of Uighur Turks fleeing from their East Turkestan (Xinjiang) homeland due to a tightening of crackdown measures on the native ethnic community by the Chinese government.
