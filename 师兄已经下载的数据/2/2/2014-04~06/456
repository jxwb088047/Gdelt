China's president promises more jobs, schools in Muslim northwest to defuse tensions | Fox News
BEIJING –  China's president has promised more jobs and school opportunities in the country's restive Muslim northwest in an apparent effort to cool tensions there after a bombing last week killed dozens of people.
At a meeting Thursday, President Xi Jinping and other leaders emphasized the need for an anti-terrorism crackdown in the Xinjiang region, but also laid out favorable policies, according to a Cabinet statement.
The government has blamed the May 22 bombing that killed 43 people in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, on separatists from the region's Uighur (pronounced WEE'-gur) ethnic minority. But Uighur activists say tensions are fueled by an influx of settlers from China's Han ethnic majority and official discrimination that indigenous groups complain has marginalized them.
