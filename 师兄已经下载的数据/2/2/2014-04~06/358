China mulling the tricks of the trade - The China Post
China expects a substantial increase in trade with its neighbors in coming years. Trade with Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, totaled US$40 billion in 2013 after several years of double-digit increases.
Trade with South Asia has also risen steadily, from US$35 billion in 2006 to US$100 billion last year. Where Southeast Asia is concerned, trade is even bigger. Two-way trade with ASEAN reached US$443.6 billion last year and the two sides have agreed on a target on US$1 trillion by 2020.
However, Beijing needs to temper its optimism with realities on the ground. The recent rise in terrorist incidents not only in Xinjiang but in other parts of the country is a strong signal that China needs to revise its policy on ethnic minorities. The self-immolations of Tibetans and attacks by Uighur groups on Han civilians are clear signs that the minorities policy is not working.
If Beijing wants the "economic belt" to develop smoothly, it needs to create conditions under which the minorities are happy to be part of China and end the current policy of drowning the minorities in a sea of Han immigrants.
Where the maritime road is concerned, China needs to mend fences with its neighbors in Southeast Asia. The policy of intimidation of smaller countries with which China has territorial and maritime disputes is creating great suspicion of China and what it might do in the future and making those countries look to the United States for support.
Unless China mends its relations with neighbors like Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, Southeast Asia may well turn into a stumbling block rather than a stepping stone in Chinese attempts to pave a maritime road to India, Africa and into Europe.
