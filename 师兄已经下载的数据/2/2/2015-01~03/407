China forces imams to dance in street
In China, imams are being forced to dans, at the same time being made to make an oath to keep children away from religion - public servants are forced to brandish the slogan that "our income comes from the CKP not from Allah".
The imams of the mosques in the Xinjiang (East Turkestan) have been forerced to gather in a square dancing en masse. State Chinese news have said that in the name of "civilization" the imams have been forced to dance in the town square.
During the speeches, young people were told to stay away from mosques, and that the prayer was harmful to ones health and instead were encouraged to dance. Female teachers were instructed to teach children to stay away from religious education and made to swear an oath that they will keep children away from religion.
Funny... you don’t see ANY instances of Islamist terrorists bombing over there in China...
hmmmmm.... I suppose it’s because they’re so TOLERANT and NICE to the rag-heads, huh?
With the success of fracking in the US, China becomes the new “best customer” of oil from the mideast towelheads.
You know, that country with mafia business practices and 1.5b expendable people to enforce them.
Since islam terror is funded by oil money, I’m rather bullish.
Chinese Communists and PRC are and have been long time allies of the radical Muslim regimes.
For example, if Iran gets the nuke it will have been aided by Chna over decades to accomplish it.
That’s correct, but they don’t let them come in and take over their country like European countries have.
Reminds of that movie with Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy, “Best Defense” where EM’s character confronts a jihadi and tells him,
“do Michael Jackson!”
(fires rifle)
Jihadi starts jumping around.
“Now do James Brown!”
(fires rifle again)
Jihadi runs away.

Most of the terrorist attacks in China are blamed in Western media as “urgyur seperatists”, all Muslim, if reported at all.

The Han Chinese know them and loath them, and they are correct to suppress them as recent events in the Uighur Autonomous Region demonstrates

Imagine how well young Muslims will listen to these Imams preaching the glory of dying in Jihad, after watching them choose to dance in the street rather than be subjected to penalties themselves.

So how is that China letting them take over their country, or am I reading your post wrong?
I'm no fan of Communist China by any means, but I cannot fault their approach at combating the “insurgents” so far. They have little choice, and it falls in line with their overall strategy when dealing with dissidents that they deem “undesirable”, so this is neither shocking nor unexpected considering the tactics they employ in such “circumstances”, and although it may be effective in their totalitarian society, it would likely never be tolerated nor considered as an effective tactic in “Western Society”, nor even considered given our appeasing mindset.
I'm not stating that their way is “better’ or even more “effective”, but “Western society” does not allow such tactics to be employed for “self-destructive” reasons.

Those who did are eating pork fried rice right now, or else....
I didn’t know the Chinese had a sense of humor. Next thing you know they’ll have the Immans dancing and blowing trumpets.
China took over the East Turkestan country. By invasion and force.
Because they know China would think nothing of slaughtering 1 million Muslims if needed, and the world would say nothing. Look at Tibet. Two U.N. resolutions on it in the 1960s, but do you see one word about it, while Israel is constantly bashed to "end their occupation"?

Somehow I don't think either Moore or Murphy want to be reminded of that film.

“Funny... you dont see ANY instances of Islamist terrorists bombing over there in China...”
Actually the Chi-Coms are scared to death of the Muslim extremist/separatist in Western China.
In (I think 1997) they called for a conference of all the extremist leaders to negotiate a deal in I think Turkmenistan and machine gunned over 1000 of the leaders when they actually showed up.
This made the papers for one day in Hong Kong and then the matter sort of disappeared. The imams in China know which side the bread is buttered on and know the limits claiming (Ba)allah’s protection.
Oh, it doesn’t matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
“Funny... you dont see ANY instances of Islamist terrorists bombing over there in China...”
Bombing, no, but organized attacks on crowds of civilians by multiple attackers with edged weapons (variously described as swords or machetes) have occurred.
It is pathetic that in an age of computers, CNC machines, and nuclear know-how amassed over 70 years that the primitives in Iran take decades to try and produce a nuclear weapon. America did it in the 1940s when everything was theoretical, using analog technology, in the middle of a world war. Iranians should hang their heads in shame but they won’t -because their heads are up their asses.
It looks like Multiculturalism and Diversity is doing well in China.
China looks to be the ONLY COUNTRY where minority Muslims are being treated in VIRTUALLY THE SAME WAY as minority Christians in Muslim countries.
You’re leaving out America in that list of countries kissing up to the muzzies.
My guess is after the feast they get to be ... organ donors.
Turning them into clowns. I don’t think this will slow down the Islamist attacks in western China at all.
I sort of doubt that it will have any positive effects whatsoever..but tha’s the comminust chinese for ya.
