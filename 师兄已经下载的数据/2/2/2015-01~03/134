Hey there, time traveller!
This article was published 14/3/2015 (374 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.
Anywhere else the delivery of food, tents and blankets to victims of avalanches in a neighbouring country would be seen as a welcome but unremarkable humanitarian act. Not, given their history of poisonous bilateral relations, when Afghanistan is the recipient and the donor is Pakistan.
The arrival of Pakistani help in the stricken Panjshir valley, where snowfalls have killed more than 280 people, is a sign of how markedly relations between the two countries have improved of late. Now Pakistan may be poised to help broker talks between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban, who have long fought a bloody insurgency against it. Even an uncertain prospect of negotiations is significant.
Rahmat Gul / The Associated PressAfghan President Ashraf Ghani took the unusual step of reaching out to Pakistanï¿½s military leader, Raheel Sharif, not the prime minister, during a visit last year.
Much credit for the improvement goes to President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, who took office in September. In an early speech, Ghani declared Pakistan to be his priority and consigned India, once a tight ally of Afghanistan's, to the outer rings of a "five circle" foreign policy.
Whereas his predecessor, president Hamid Karzai, made frequent forays to India, Ghani has yet to visit. When he went to Pakistan in November, he broke protocol by calling on Gen. Raheel Sharif, the army chief who, more than his unrelated namesake, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, holds real power in Pakistan. That courtesy caused dismay among those back home for whom the Pakistani army is a source of all evil, most notably as the Taliban's historical backer.
"Nothing he has done has caused more dishonour to Afghanistan," fumed former foreign minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta.
Since then the general has made many reciprocal visits to Kabul. Ghani has ordered his security forces to work with their Pakistani counterparts on managing a volatile border. He also has sent cadets to enrol in Pakistan's military academy in Abbottabad, in contrast to Karzai's preference for training officers in India rather than in Pakistan. This counters Pakistani anxiety over the Afghan army's future leaders being indoctrinated by a mortal enemy.
Perhaps most strikingly, Ghani is diverting soldiers away from the fight against the Afghan Taliban -- on March 3 a suicide bomber killed nine soldiers in Helmand province -- to deal instead with Pakistan's own version of the Taliban, Tehreeke-Taliban Pakistan, whose militants have taken refuge in Dangam in eastern Afghanistan. After December, when TTP men attacked a school for army families in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan, killing 132 children, Ghani's is a notable gesture.
He now needs to win a big prize in return if he is not to be written off as a stooge of Pakistan. The Pakistani army must help lure the Afghan Taliban into early peace talks. Mid-ranking officers in the Pakistani army and its spy agencies have traditionally opposed that, however. In private they say the Afghan Taliban poses no threat to Pakistan itself, while providing a useful channel for Pakistan to influence events across the border.
The good news is Sharif is clear-eyed about how negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban could help bring wider stability to the region. Pakistan has its own chronic problems with terrorists, as the December massacre in Peshawar brought painfully home.
The Pakistani authorities have influence over the Afghan Taliban, whose leaders enjoy broad protection in the Pakistani cities of Quetta, Karachi, Peshawar and elsewhere. Many Taliban own property in Pakistan, and their children attend local schools. The Quetta Shura, their ruling council, remains intact.
A senior western diplomat in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, believes the Pakistanis are actively pushing the Afghan Taliban into negotiations. He judges that among the Taliban are "reasonable people" ready to be guided by instructions from their leader, Mullah Omar, should he sue for peace.
Back channels between the Afghan Taliban and the government in Kabul, the Afghan capital, long have existed, yet previous hopes of talks have foundered. This time could be different.
With American-led foreign troops withdrawing, it is tougher for the Taliban to claim to be fighting a patriotic war against foreign occupiers. Furthermore, if Afghan security forces survive their first full fighting season without NATO firepower, it might disabuse those militants who believe that only American forces are denying them victory. Afghan security forces are losing more men in a year -- 4,350 in 2013, the latest year with full statistics -- than all foreign troops killed since 2001, but the 169,000-strong army and the police remain forces to be reckoned with. They should easily deny the Taliban their grandiose promise to capture the provinces of Helmand and Kunar this year.
Further, useful diplomacy is being brought to bear. China, Pakistan's closest ally, has hosted Taliban delegations in Beijing in hope of securing peace. China has mining interests in Afghanistan, and it also is increasingly concerned about Islamist militancy among its Uighur population. It would like to see a more stable region. America, too, supports peace talks with the Taliban, after previously having opposed them.
Some Afghan politicians envisage two years of peace talks, with the Taliban then taking part in parliamentary elections. A national council, a loya jirga, is already planned, giving parliament more powers. Might the Taliban be a part of that effort?
The problem is Ghani probably does not have two years. His standing at home is already weakened by the way he came to power, in an election so tainted by fraud that supporters of his rival, Abdullah Abdullah, claimed their candidate had been cheated. Although Ghani struck a power-sharing deal with Abdullah, antagonism between the two camps remains high, and there are problems in forming a government.
That is all before taking into consideration how deeply unpopular in some quarters Ghani's policy of co-operating with Pakistan remains. Karzai continues to snipe from his mini-palace, a short distance from Ghani's office, warning that Afghanistan must not "be under Pakistan's thumb."
If he is to survive in office, Ghani needs early results to show for his endeavours to find peace.
