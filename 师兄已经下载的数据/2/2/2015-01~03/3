Police kill six attackers in Xinjiang: state media - The China Post
There were no police or civilian casualties, according to the report by Xinjiang's government-run Tianshan news site.
Xinjiang is home to China's nine-million-strong Turkic-speaking and mostly Muslim ethnic minority.
Monday's clash was triggered when residents of Shule county, near the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, noticed "a suspicious person carrying an explosive device," Tianshan said.
They called police, who opened fire after the attacker tried to set upon an officer with an axe and detonate the device, according to the report.
The assailant was killed, but soon afterwards five more attackers "sought to ignite explosive devices one after the other," Tianshan said.
The five were "resolutely" shot dead by police, it added.
China's ruling Communist Party tightly restricts access to the restive region, and information is difficult to independently verify.
Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the overseas-based World Uyghur Congress, said that "several dozen" Uighurs had been detained by authorities in the wake of the incident.
"China's allegations of a so-called terrorist attack are an excuse to cover up the excessive use of force," he said in a statement.
He pointed to China's "hostile policies" in the region as having triggered unrest, without citing specifics.
On Saturday, Xinjiang's regional legislature voted to ban the wearing of burqas in public areas in Urumqi, Xinhua reported.
The measure "is seen as an effort to curb growing extremism that forced Uighur women to abandon their colorful traditional dress and wear black burqas," the news agency said.
