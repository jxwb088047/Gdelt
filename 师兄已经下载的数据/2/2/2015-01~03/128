Wrong policies | Arab News
The report “Uighur gets 6 years in jail for growing beard” (March 30) is very alarming. It is sad to note that Muslims are being treated badly all across the world. We usually blame terrorist organizations like the self-ascribed Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Tehreek-e-Taleban Pakistan (TTP) for giving a bad name to Islam. But why do all the governments see a potential terrorist in an ordinary Muslim who is devout and wishes to stick to the fundamental teachings of his religion. In Europe, anti-veil campaign is gathering storm and the governments appear to be helpless in the face of such discriminatory movements. Now Muslim beards are under attack. I believe such incidents radicalize the Muslim youths and only help terrorist organizations find recruits. Muslims should be left alone to practice their religion. Only those who are found guilty of any wrongdoing should be targeted. These policies are not helpful in the fight against terrorism. Terrorist organizations usually cite such incidents to lure unassuming people into their ranks. — Taha Jamal, Dammam
