Police shoot down 6 alleged assailants in Xinjiang : Shanghaiist
Police in Xinjiang killed six people who they say were attempting to detonate a bomb, according to local media reports.
The officers shot down the purported assailants in Shule, part of the Kasghar prefecture, BBC said, citing a brief report from the local government news portal Tianshan.
The news report added that residents had reported a man carrying a suspicious-looking device, and as police approached him, he'd attempted to attack them and set off the device. He was immediately shot dead, followed by five others who tried to detonate the explosives. Xinhua also confirmed today that police had killed six "mobsters" in Xinjiang.
This is just the latest in a string of deadly attacks within the restive region of Xinjiang. The government has blamed the outbreak of violence on separatists from the Uyghur ethnic minority. Last month, a court in Urumqi sentenced eight people to death for attacks on a train station and a shopping market in April and May, respectively, that left around 40 people dead in total.
