Xinjiang's anti-drug campaign gains steam - People's Daily Online

 URUMQI, March 27 -- Police in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region cracked 2,158 drug cases in 2014 and confiscated 2.8 tonnes of drugs, as regional anti-drug raids gain steam.

 Last year's campaign saw a total of 2,254 suspects arrested by police, with roughly 15,000 drug users punished, according to the latest statistics from the regional anti-drug work conference.

 Xinjiang will continue to crackdown on illegal activities involving drugs this year, particularly such activities on the Internet, according to the conference.

 Xinjiang is adjacent to the Golden Crescent, one of the largest opium producing regions in the world. In recent years, local police have increased anti-drug efforts by working with international colleagues as the region continues opening to the outside.
