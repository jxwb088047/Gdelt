Now let's check out how people in other places celebrate the lunar new year, starting from Tibet.
Performers sang and danced at the foot of the Potala palace.The Tibetan New Year happens to coincide with the Chinese New year this year. In Tibetan culture, 2015 is the year of the wood sheep. Every year is also assigned a gender - this year is female, which is said to bear peace.Meanwhile, a moving new year gala - on a train heading from Northeast China to the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in the northwest.
"This took me by surprise, I love the festive spirit and atmosphere," said a passenger.
"Though I'm not with my family, I feel happy here."
A dozen foreign visitors joined in the festivities at a village near eastern city Ningbo, getting their fill of hand-made ginger candy and animal shaped rice cakes.Dragons can be seen everywhere - an auspicous symbol. And the dragon dance is a propitious part of any new year celebration.And finally a calligrapher in the city of Nanjing marked the year with 100 seals of different depictions of - you guessed it - sheep, and printed them on paper. They are based on drawings from many Chinese dynasties thoughout the centuries.
