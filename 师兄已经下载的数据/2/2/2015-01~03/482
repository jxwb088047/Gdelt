Negative Fox News Article Removal Causes Mickey Kaus To Quit
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 23, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses a blogger quitting conservative blog The Daily Caller after an article that was critical of Fox News is removed.
It’s fair and balanced so long as you don’t question it. Mickey Kaus quit The Daily Caller once an article that was critical of Fox News was pulled. Tucker Carlson, the editor-in-chief, told Kaus that since Carlson worked at Fox he wouldn’t allow any negative articles to be published. The article in question attacked Fox News for not being nearly vigilant enough in opposing immigration and illegal aliens. It seemed that no matter which side of issues you found yourself that everyone was scared of Fox, according to Kaus.”
Should the article have been removed? Let us know in the comments section below.
