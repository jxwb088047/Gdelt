The fifth and final suspect accused of attacking police officers with knives in southern China's Guangxi has been captured.
The five men, all said to be from Xinjiang, were trying to cross into Vietnam on Sunday.
Two were shot dead by police during the confrontation and two others were arrested.
The last one was arrested Monday night in a nearby city after a manhunt was launched within the region.
Police say the five are terror suspects who had been hoping to find safe refuge outside of China.
China's Ministry of Public Security waged a special campaign to crack down on organized human smuggling in May last year in the country's southwestern border regions, as such cases had been on the rise in those regions since the beginning of last year.
Gao Zhaoyi is with the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.
"Smugglers cajole people into this by telling them how happy they and their family will be after crossing the border. But in most cases, their lives become desperate, as they don't have money and personal safety. This means young people are sacrificed to 'jihadists'. In cases like this, often times the old, women, and children are abandoned."
Mehmetti al-Shem is one of those who left China with the hope of joining a 'jihad'.
"In the beginning, I thought we would be living in pretty good conditions. However, things were extremly bad. We did not have access to drinking water and could only eat dry naan bread for two months. I really regret making the decision, and I even thought of going to war in Syria, and ending my life there."
To date, police have busted 262 human smuggling cases, capturing 352 suspects who allegedly organized such activities, and 852 suspects who attempted to cross the border illegally.
