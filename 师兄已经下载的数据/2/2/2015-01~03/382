SIX attackers with explosive devices were killed by police in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Monday morning, local authorities said.
A suspect with an explosive device was spotted by local residents at about 10:10 am in a commercial district in Shule County. The suspect, who later attacked police with an axe and tried to detonate the device, was shot dead by police.
When the police were handling the suspect, another five attackers attempted to ignite explosive devices attached to their bodies. They were killed by the police on the spot.
A minibus with explosive devices was also spotted at the site.
