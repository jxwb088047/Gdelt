- China indices are leading Asia trade yet again, with particular strength observed among the property developers on expectation of more govt intervention. China property price average in the top 70 cities fell for the 10th consecutive month sequentially, and y/y decline accelerated to -5.7% from -5.1%. Top-tier Beijing and Shanghai markets were not immune to the February slowdown, falling by 3.6% and 4.7% respectively. Stats Bureau has once again hid behind the holiday seasonality in explaining away the decline, forecasting a significant rebound in March.
- All eyes are on the FOMC policy statement in the US on Wednesday, with much of the focus falling on whether the statement will take out the "patient" language as forecasted by Fed watcher Hilsenrath. USD majors are particularly quiet before tomorrow's storm - EUR/USD is trading about 10pips on either side of $1.06 mark, USD/JPY is in a 15pip range below 121.40, and AUD/USD in a 20pip range below 0.7630. NZD fell nearly 100pips during the US session, accentuated by loss following the first decline in Fonterra auction price in 4 months, but remains supported above 0.73 in Asia. Also of note in New Zealand, Q4 current account registered a slightly wider than expected current account deficit ahead of tomorrow's GDP report.
- In Japan, a number of automakers largely confirmed press speculation related to their spring wage negotiations - Toyota raises monthly base pay by ¥4K, Nissan by ¥5K, and Mitsubishi Motors by ¥2K - well below its union's request of ¥6K/month. Sony revised its Q3 higher and traded up 5%, while Nintendo was in bid-only mode up 20% on partnership with DeNA in mobile gaming. Japan trade data finally showed some improvement, posting its smallest headline deficit in 2 years on much higher than expected exports and surprise decline in imports. Shipments to China fell 14%, but those to US were up 14% and Europe up 2%.
