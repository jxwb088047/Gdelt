Xinjiang province in China bans wearing of burqa by Muslim women
Beijing: The Communist Party leadership in China's troubled province Zinjiang has decided to ban the wearing of Burga (veil) by Muslim women.
The decision to ban burqa was taken last month, and this was approved by the provincial legislature.
China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported:  " The regulation is seen as an effort to curb growing extremism that forced Uygur women to abandon their colourful traditional dress and wear black burqas".
Xinhua also noted that the Burqa has been banned in Belgium and France, and that it is "not a national dress of Muslims".
Xinjiang is a Muslim inhabited province, and it borders Muslim countries of Central Asia and Pakistan.
Separatists in Xinjiang province are fighting for an independent East Turkmenistan.
