While Israel advocates for open borders in Europe and organizations like \"IsraAID\" and programs funded by billionaires like George Soros or Rothschild funds actively encourage millions of Muslims to illegally cross the borders of European nations, the humanitarian situation on Israeli borders looks much different.

\"Invaders\", as the prime minister Netanyahu himself calls them, are ordered to be shot in sight if they try to enter illegally. The \"Invaders\" are either refused entry or killed - if they get a temporary permit they are often sterilized and deported as soon as possible to ensure they don\'t \"taint the Jewish essence\" with their \"dirty genes\". Black people are considered worth less than cockroaches. Mixed-race marriages are illegal. In order to legally immigrate, you have to do extensive DNA testing or provide proof of your ancestry. \"Racemixing\" will ruin your reputation and expel you from the Jewish community permanently. Already existing walls that put any European border to shame are to be reinforced with landmines, automatic set guns and heavy armaments to keep out, I quote Netanyahu again, \"wild beasts\".

\"Netanyahu: We\'ll Surround Israel With Fences \'To Defend Ourselves Against Wild Beasts\'\"

http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.702318

While Israel\'s policies towards illegal immigration are especially cruel and simple border patrols in Europe would do the job just as well, the irony is that the most ambitious promoter of multiculturalism and \"humanitarianism\" does not only not accept a single refugee - they call them wild animals that are to be sho...

Operation Opera, also known as Operation Babylon and Raid on the Reactor, was a surprise Israeli air strike carried out on 7 June 1981, which destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction 17 kilometers, 10.5 miles, southeast of Baghdad. The operation came after Iran\'s unsuccessful Operation Scorch Sword operation had caused minor damage to the same nuclear facility the previous year, the damage having been subsequently repaired by French technicians. Operation Opera, and related Israeli government statements following it, established the Begin Doctrine, which explicitly stated the strike was not an anomaly, but instead “a precedent for every future government in Israel.” Israel\'s counter-proliferation preventive strike added another dimension to their existing policy, as it related to the nuclear capability of other states in the region. 

In 1976, Iraq purchased an \"Osiris\"-class nuclear reactor from France. While Iraq and France maintained that the reactor, named Osirak by the French, was intended for peaceful scientific research, the Israelis viewed the reactor with suspicion, and said that it was designed to make nuclear weapons. On 7 June 1981, a flight of Israeli Air Force F-16A fighter aircraft, with an escort of F-15As, bombed and heavily damaged the Osirak reactor. Israel claimed it acted in self-defense, and that the reactor had \"less than a month to go\" before \"it might have become critical.Ten Iraqi soldiers and one French civilian were killed.

In which John Green teaches you about conflict in Israel and Palestine. This conflict is often cast as a long-term beef going back thousands of years, and rooted in a clash between religions. Well, that\'s not quite true. What is true is that the conflict is immensely complicated, and just about everyone in the world has an opinion about it. John is going to try to get the facts across in under 13 minutes.

Documentary on the history of Judaism, the Bible (Torah/Tanakh) and the Jewish people of Israel. Using the latest archaeological evidence from the stables of Ramses ll to little-known ancient Egyptian texts, Egyptologist and Bible Archaeologist show that Israel did in fact exist and had a presence in ancient Egypt. 
\"The Bible\'s Buried Secrets\" is the title of a NOVA program that stirred controversy even before its first airing on PBS, on November 18, 2008. According to the program\'s official website: \"The film presents the latest archeological scholarship from the Holy Land to explore the beginnings of modern religion and the origins of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament.

Você Merece Cachê (part. Wesley Safadão)

Só faltou botar uma
Bolinha vermelhinha em meu nariz
E sair me chamando de palhaço
Jurou amor mas só me usou
E depois me traiu, fez o que fez
Deixou o meu coração em pedaços

Ah, como você é desumana
Ah, depois que pisa em quem te ama
Se arrepende e quer voltar

Grita, se humilha, na maior cena de choro
Quase que consegue me ganhar

Você merece cachê, seu show foi bom demais
Foi tão bonito, quase que eu volto atrás
Você merece cachê, seu show foi bom demais
Foi tão bonito, quase que eu volto atrás

Chorou que soluçou, se ajoelhou
Pedindo pra voltar e eu só vendo
Chorou que soluçou, se ajoelhou
Ei, pera aí, a Globo tá te perdendo

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

Operation Orchard[2][3] (Hebrew: מבצע בוסתן‎, Mivtza bustan) was an Israeli airstrike on a suspected nuclear reactor[4] in the Deir ez-Zor region[5] of Syria, which occurred just after midnight (local time) on September 6, 2007. The Israeli and U.S. governments imposed virtually total news blackouts immediately after the raid that held for seven months.[6] The White House and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) subsequently confirmed that American intelligence had also indicated the site was a nuclear facility with a military purpose, though Syria denies this.[7][8] A 2009 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation reported evidence of uranium and graphite and concluded that the site bore features resembling an undeclared nuclear reactor. IAEA was initially unable to confirm or deny the nature of the site because, according to IAEA, Syria failed to provide necessary cooperation with the IAEA investigation.[9][10] Syria has disputed these claims.[11] Nearly four years later, in April 2011, the IAEA officially confirmed that the site was a nuclear reactor.[4]

The Israeli attack followed top-level consultations with the Bush Administration. After realizing that the US was not willing to take its own military action, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert decided to adhere to the 1981 Begin Doctrine and unilaterally strike to prevent a Syrian nuclear weapons capability, despite serious concerns about Syrian retaliation. In stark contrast to the doctrine\'s prior usage against Iraq, the airstrike against Syria did not elicit international o...

Israel, officially the State of Israel ( /ˈɪzriːəl/ or  /ˈɪzreɪəl/; Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל‎, Medīnat Yisrā'el, IPA: [me̞diˈnät jisʁäˈʔe̞l] ( listen); Arabic: دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل‎, Dawlat Isrāʼīl, IPA: [dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl]), is a parliamentary republic in the Middle East, along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Lebanon in the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank in the east, Egypt and the Gaza Strip on the southwest, and the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea to the south, and it contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel is defined as a Jewish and Democratic State in its Basic Laws and is the world's only Jewish-majority state.
Following the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 29 November 1947 recommending the adoption and implementation of the United Nations plan to partition Palestine, on 14 May 1948 David Ben-Gurion, the Executive Head of the World Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel, a state independent from the British Mandate for Palestine. Neighboring Arab states invaded the next day in support of the Palestinian Arabs. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Portions of these territories, including east Jerusalem, have been annexed by Israel, but the border with the neighboring West Bank has not yet been permanently defined.[neutrality is disputed] Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, but efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have so far not resulted in peace.
