Cops shoot dead two Uighurs in south China - Regional | The Star Online
BEIJING: Police in southern China shot dead two Uighurs trying to cross the border into Vietnam, state media reported, with rights groups saying repression at home causes members of the ethnic minority to flee.
Officers discovered a group of Uighurs near a highway toll gate on Sunday evening and two who “assaulted” the officers with knives were shot dead, the government-run China News Service said.
Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking and mostly Muslim ethnic minority, whose resource-rich homeland Xinjiang has seen intensifying and increasingly sophisticated attacks, sometimes spreading beyond it.
Two more people were detained while police were still searching for a fifth in Pingxiang city in the southern region of Guangxi, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Calls to the Pingxiang municipal public security bureau went unanswered.
At least 200 people have been killed in a series of clashes over the past year linked to Xinjiang, with authorities blaming religious extremists and separatists in the region.
Rights groups argue that harsh police treatment of the Uighur minority, as well as government campaigns against religious practices have led to violence. — AFP
