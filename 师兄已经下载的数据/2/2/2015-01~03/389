Six Shot Dead By Police In China's Troubled Xinjiang Province
At least six people, termed as attackers by the local authorities, were shot dead by the police in China's restive Xinjiang province on Monday. The police claimed to have shot dead the six men when they tried to set off an explosive device and threatened officials with knives and other weapons.
The six men were intercepted by the police in Shule county, near Kashgar City, after being tipped off by an informant. Authorities say the armed men attacked police officials when challenged and were found to possess explosive devices and arms including an axe. Officials said the police then had no option but to open fire, killing all the six men in the process.
There were no other injuries to the police or civilians during the incident. Officials said a minibus loaded with explosives was later found in an area, close to the incident region.
Since news from the Xinjiang region is tightly monitored by the ruling Communist Party of China, there is no independent verification to the official version of the incident.
Violence in the Xinjiang region has been on the up ever since the Chinese government clamped down on activists around the area, restricting the local population in their movement and activities. At least 200 people have been reportedly killed in the region since the last one year.
There are about 9 million Uighurs in Xinjiang, most of whom believe have been sidelined by the Chinese government policies that generally favors the Han ethnic group. Several groups have accused the police of excesses and repressive policies against the the local Uighur population, but Beijing denies such charges.
