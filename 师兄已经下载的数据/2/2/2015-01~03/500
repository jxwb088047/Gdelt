World news in brief, 1/20
LONDON — The richest 1 percent of the world’s population will soon own more than half of global wealth, unless there is drastic wealth redistribution, Oxfam said Monday.
The British charity said the share of the world’s wealth owned by the richest 1 percent rose from 44 percent in 2009 to 48 percent last year, and that 2015 would see half the world’s wealth in the hands of just 1 percent.
Oxfam, which used data from a series of Credit Suisse reports, said that over half of the wealth not owned by the richest 1 percent belongs to the richest 20 percent.
Some economists have taken issue with Oxfam’s reading of the statistics, noting that early-career professionals who spend all their income would fall into the “poor” classification and that people in rich countries who own even modest homes would come within the world’s top 1 percent in asset terms.
BEIJING — Chinese police shot and killed two members of the Uighur minority group late Sunday as they attempted to cross the border illegally into Vietnam and assaulted Chinese border guards who tried to stop them, state media reported Monday.
It was the latest clash between police and Uighurs — a largely Muslim ethnic group from China’s western frontier — who were apparently trying to flee the country.
According to state media, the would-be exiles clashed with police in Pingxiang, a town near the border with Vietnam. A third Uighur escaped. China Daily reported that the three attacked police with knives, a detail not included in a report from the China News Service.
Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking ethnic group, largely Muslim, whose homeland is what is now China’s Xinjiang region. Many resent China’s rule over the area.
SEOUL — The former Korean Air executive famous for an in-flight tantrum over macadamia nuts pleaded not guilty Monday to violating aviation safety law and hindering a government investigation.
Lawyers for Cho Hyun-ah did not dispute the major elements of the prosecutor’s account of events on Dec. 5, when Cho forced a Korean Air jet to return to the gate. Instead, they are focusing on a technical rebuttal.
Cho spent most of the first day of her trial Monday with her head lowered and hair covering her face. Cho’s attorney Yu Seung-nam said Cho is unable to mentally recover from her ordeal, as she has been “beaten” by the media.
Cho, who is the daughter of Korean Air’s chairman, achieved worldwide notoriety by kicking the chief flight attendant off a Dec. 5 flight after another crew member offered her macadamia nuts in a bag, instead of on a dish. At the time, Cho was vice president of cabin service at the airline.
Her behavior, dubbed nut rage, caused an uproar and touched a nerve in a country where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates.
