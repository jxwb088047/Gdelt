Your Oil & Gas News | Roxi Petroleum plc: Proposed Sale of the Galaz Contract Area
Roxi, the Central Asian oil and gas company with a focus on 
Kazakhstan, is pleased to update the market with news of the Galaz 
Contract Area in which it holds an interest of 34.22 per cent.
Roxi
 notes the announcement made by Xinjiang Zhundong Petroleum Technology 
Co., ("Xinjiang Zhundong") a Company listed on the Shenzhen Stock 
Exchange in China, in connection with the potential acquisition of 100% 
of the Galaz Contract Area ("Galaz") for an aggregate consideration of 
up to $100 million including the assumption of debt and for which it has
 been granted an exclusivity period to 31 January 2015.
Roxi is 
pleased to confirm that although there is no certainty that a sale will 
be concluded on the terms disclosed, it has entered into a non-binding 
heads of terms and is working with Xinjiang Zhundong and the other 
shareholders in Galaz to complete the sale of Galaz on the terms 
disclosed below and expects to make a further announcement once all the 
relevant legally binding agreements have been entered into.
Xinjiang
 Zhundong announced that it is leading a consortium seeking to acquire 
100% of the equity and associated debt of Galaz by the acquisition of 
the Kazakh entity Galaz & Co LLP that holds the licence for the 
Galaz Contract Area for an aggregate consideration of no more than $100 
million.
The proposal is subject to due diligence and on the 
signing of binding documentation and would be conditional on approval of
 both Kazakh and Chinese regulatory authorities.
Of
 the $100 million disclosed approximately $50.4m relates to the equity 
of Galaz & Co LLP, in which Roxi has a 34.22% interest and 
approximately $49.6m relates to the assumption of shareholder loans owed
 by Galaz & Co LLP, of which approximately $11.3 million is owed to 
Roxi.
In aggregate the share of the $100 million disclosed attributable to Roxi is expected to be some $28 million.
Under
 the terms of the 2008 acquisition of 59% of Eragon Petroleum PLC 
("Eragon") from Baverstock GmbH ("Baverstock"), Roxi has an obligation 
to carry Baverstock for the first $100 million of costs on the Eragon 
assets (BNG, Galaz & Munaily). This obligation has almost been 
fulfilled. Therefore the proceeds attributable to Baverstock, which 
would be an additional $12 million, would also be available for the 
development of the BNG Contract Area.
Including the contribution 
from Baverstock the proposed proceeds from the sale of Galaz on the 
terms announced by Xinjiang Zhundong would fund at least four deep wells
 at BNG.
The
 Galaz block is located in the Kyzylorda Oblast in central Kazakhstan. 
The Contract Area was extended on 10 January 2011 to 179 square 
kilometres and now includes significant exploration upside on the east 
side of the Karatau fault system, as well as the NW Konys development.
Pilot
 production commenced on 19 January 2012 following approval of the NW 
Konys Pilot Production Plan from the Ministry of Oil and Gas, with 
emissions and flaring permits received from the relevant authorities.
Since
 2008 17 wells have been drilled at Galaz, a significant number of which
 are or indicate they will be commercial. Wells NK-3, NK-5, NK-7, NK-8, 
and NK-9 are on extended test producing in aggregate 1,000 bopd on 
average. Additionally, Wells NK-4, NK6, NK-12 and NK-31 are being 
prepared to commence test production.
Roxi
 has an effective 34.22 per cent interest in Galaz, which runs on an 
exploration basis until 14 May 2016. The other principal shareholders in
