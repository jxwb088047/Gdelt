Another MUST SEE - \"THE NAZIS AND THE PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT\" at http://vimeo.com/69991225 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjARZPAcATM

Original video at http://vimeo.com/77053361 from http://vimeo.com/faceshirhome
See also https://www.youtube.com/user/FACESHIRHOME



The video dispels certain myths concerning the origin of the name \'Palestine\' and of the \'Arab Palestinians.\' It documents that the \'Arab Palestinians\' are in fact mostly from other places, and migrated to what is now Israel at the same time as the Zionist Jews, many of them because of the economic boom that the Zionist Jews produced in what was then British Mandate Palestine. The Zionist Jews did not steal the \"best\" land from Arab landowners but in fact purchased abandoned desert and swamp land from absentee Arab landlords who were quite eager to sell. This was explained by Hajj Amin al Husseini himself. Husseini, father of the Palestinian movement, launched his fourth terrorist attack against the Jews of the Mandate in 1936-39. The violence was so great that the British sent a team to investigate. When questioned, Husseini admitted that the Zionist Jews had not stolen anybody\'s land but in fact had bought it. In fact, Husseini had been among the major consolidators and sellers of land, and growing tremendously rich by it.

We often hear claims about the Palestinians being a 5,000 years ancient and indigenous people, including the claim that Jesus was a Palestinian. In a highly politicized public opinion war, it\'s worth asking: what\'s fact and what\'s fiction?...

The Arabs who occupy the land of Israel want this video to be removed .
Feel free to copy this video and help spread the truth the palestinians seek to deny.

Jerusalem : Muslims and Jews
Or :
How and why palestinians desecrate the Temple Mount and Jerusalem.

One of the most important videos on youtube that sheds light on the Jewish-Arab conflict.

Jerusalem has been a Jewish holy city since the days of King David . 3000 years ago.
At that time the Arabs were still pagans who used to worship idols such as Al Uzza, Al Lat and Al Mannat at the Kaaba. (Jahiliyya period)

In the year 638 CE the muslims captured Jerusalem from the Byzantines and built a mosque on the site of the Jewish holy Temple.

While Jews pray facing Jerusalem and the Temple mount , Muslims pray towards Mecca.
When Muslims pray in Jerusalem they point their behind to the Dome of the rock and the temple mount.

An Islamic holy site ?
Palestinians use the temple mount as a playground where they have picnics and play soccer.

Sary Nusseibeh , palestinian professor and the president of the Al Quds university had to go underground after admitting that the temple mount is a Jewish holy site.

Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328) , whose writings influenced the Wahhabi movement in arabia ruled that sacred islamic sites are to be found only in the Arabian Peninsula and that \" in Jerusalem, there is not a place one calls sacred , and the same holds true for the tombs of Hebron\"

Jerusalem is mentioned in the Bible 667 times , while in the Quran : 0 times .

According to the quran , the holy land was written by Allah to Israel...

The Palestinian people, (Arabic: الشعب الفلسطيني‎, ash-sha‘b al-Filasṭīnī) also referred to as Palestinians (Arabic: الفلسطينيون‎, al-Filasṭīniyyūn), are descendants of the peoples who have lived in Palestine over the centuries. Today, Palestinians are largely culturally and linguistically Arab. Despite various wars and exoduses, roughly one half of the world's Palestinian population continues to reside in the area encompassing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Israel. In this combined area, as of 2004, Palestinians constituted 49% of all inhabitants, encompassing the entire population of the Gaza Strip (1.6 million), the majority of the population of the West Bank (approximately 2.3 million versus close to 500,000 Jewish Israeli citizens which includes about 200,000 in East Jerusalem), and 16.5% of the population of Israel proper as Arab citizens of Israel.
Throughout the aforementioned combined area, many are Palestinian refugees or internally displaced Palestinians, including more than a million in the Gaza Strip, three-quarters of a million in the West Bank,, and about a quarter of a million in Israel proper. Of the Palestinian population who live abroad, making up what is known as the Palestinian diaspora, more than half of these are stateless refugees lacking citizenship in any country. About 2.6 million of the diaspora population live in neighboring Jordan where they make up approximately half the population, 1.5 million live between Syria and Lebanon, a quarter of a million in Saudi Arabia, with Chile's half a million representing the largest concentration outside the Arab world.
