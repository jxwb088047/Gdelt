Uighur Dilemma (2009): Ever since the violence between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese, a fear of fanaticism has taken hold. Is the government\'s decision to demolish the Uighur area Kashgar really due to an earthquake threat?

For downloads and more information visit http://journeyman.tv/59768/short-films/uighur-dilemma.html

Kashgar is a cultural icon. Parts of the city have stood for 2000 years and within its labyrinth, Uighur traditions are unchanged. \'We live as we did in the old times\' says Tursun, a 6 generation pot thrower. But times are changing. Beijing\'s deputy mayor has announced that destruction of the old town is the only way to prepare for an earthquake threat. \'I spent my whole childhood in this place. If they destroy it, we can\'t continue our business\' cries one of Kashgar\'s many blacksmiths. Many Uighur\'s are convinced that the authorities \'never tell the truth\'. Yet some are happy to be rehoused in government buildings, admitting that their homes are dangerous. Kashgar is of great strategic value for China - if small separatist groups here link with Taliban insurgents across the border, there could be a full-scale armed conflict in Western China. \'If a handful of religious extremists, or international terrorists appear, we will crack down on them immediately\' says Beijing\'s deputy mayor. His plan could rebuild a sour relationship. Or give the Uighurs a new reason to throw off Chinese occupation of their homeland.

Crackdown: The report on Uigher protests that broke relations between China and Australia

Xinjiang province has long been the site of ethnic tensions between the Uighur population and Chinese rule. Amid fears that fanatical Uighurs are aligning with foreign extremists, the state crackdown is fiercer than ever. 

\"A normal person wouldn\'t raise a butcher\'s knife to the elderly and children. Can we still call them human beings?\", asks policeman Ainiding Memtimin. In May he was on the scene when a group of extremists threw explosives into a busy Urumqi marketplace, killing 39 people. A Uighur himself, like most locals he is baffled by such drastic violent acts. Yet the tensions that have simmered in this region are sitting on a knife edge. \"Injustice is everywhere here, but we can\'t talk about it\", says one Uighur farmer in a snatched interview. On Xinjiang\'s highways, cars are now being stopped for full airport-style security checks. The government keeps a close eye on religious institutions and veils for women and beards for men are actively discouraged. Teaching in the Uighur language is disappearing in schools and it\'s almost non-existent at universities. And it isn\'t just the Uighurs feeling the crackdown; enormous numbers of Han Chinese have been pressed into the province to water down the Uighurs\' presence and influence. In some towns, payments are being offered for inter-marriage. But is China\'s central government using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? This report doggedly pushes past the press restrictions and government minders to tackle this difficult question.

China has increased security measures in Xinjiang following more clashes between police and members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic minority group that left dozens of people dead.
 
According to Chinese state media agency Xinhua, the clashes were a premeditated terrorist attack, but a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress said Uighurs were marching in protest against oppressive Chinese policies and restrictions during Ramadan, such as police breaking into Uighurs’ houses, making random arrests, holding detainees for interrogations, and brutally beating people on their way to the mosque. 

Clashes took place in Shache county, in the townships of Elixku and Huangdi. In Elixku, a group of assailants, wielding knives and axes, attacked a police station and government offices, the South China Morning Post reported. In the town of Huangdi, according to Xinhua, assailants damaged more than 30 police cars, burning six of them. 

Chinese police responded by shooting towards the crowd, killing dozens and leaving many wounded, Reuters reported. A spokesperson for the World Uighur Congress said 100 people were killed.

While Chinese media say violence was limited to the two towns, Uighurs say the violence also spread to Kashgar. There, a French tourist told Reuters he saw a dead body outside a mosque on Wednesday. According to the Guardian, the person found dead was a high profile Xinjiang imam who supported the Communist Party. 

The tourist told Reuters he saw armed police convoys entering the town and preventing civilians cars from coming in.

 For the six Uighurs temporarily settled in Palau following their release from Guantanamo, it is far from paradise. Trapped there, they wait anxiously for the worlds superpowers to determine their fate.
Caught up in the post-9/11 round-up of suspected terrorists, these six men were wrongfully captured by bounty hunters, and sent to Guantanamo. The life in Guantanamo was one of the darkest chapters in our lives. Officially cleared of terrorism charges, they are still forbidden to make phone calls. On their arrival in Palau, the local paper described them as, six bearded Muslim terrorists in shackles. One of the men, Adel, states simply, \"I am not dangerous.\" China is now demanding their return, in order to face charges of separatism. If Australia continues to refuse the US plea to offer them refuge, they may have a dark fate ahead of them. Their lawyer explains, The truth is, they are caught between the US and China - and that\'s not a place you want to be.

The Uyghurs (Uyghur: ئۇيغۇر‎, ULY: Uyghur; [ʔʊjˈʁʊː]; simplified Chinese: 维吾尔; traditional Chinese: 維吾爾; pinyin: Wéiwú'ěr) are a Turkic ethnic group living in Eastern and Central Asia. Today, Uyghurs live primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. An estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in the southwestern portion of the region, the Tarim Basin.
The largest community of Uyghurs outside Xinjiang in China is in Taoyuan County, in south-central Hunan province. Outside of China, significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Smaller communities are found in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkey.
Uyghur is often pronounced /ˈwiːɡər/ by English speakers, though the most acceptable English pronunciation is ooy-goor. Several alternate romanizations also appear: Uighur, Uygur and Uigur. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region provincial government recommends that the generic ethnonym [ʔʊjˈʁʊː], adopted in the early 20th century for this Turkic people, be transcribed as "Uyghur".
