Beijing, Mar 6 (EFE).- Nine people were wounded in a knife attack and one of the alleged attackers was shot dead by the police Friday at a train station in Guangzhou, in southern China, Chinese police reported, according to official Xinhua agency.
The incident, of which more details are yet to be provided, took place at 08:18, according to the Guangzhou's railway public security bureau.
The incident has not yet been attributed to any terrorist group, though similar cases last year led to Beijing blaming groups related to terrorist organizations from the northwestern Xinjiang province.
On Mar. 1, 2014, 33 people died, including four terrorists, and 148 others were wounded in an attack with knives at a railway station in Kunming, capital of China's southwestern Yunnan province.
Two months later, on Apr. 30, three people were killed and 79 others were wounded in another attack with knives and explosives at a train station in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang province.
