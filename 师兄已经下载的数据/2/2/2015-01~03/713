Two Cops Shot In Ferguson
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 12, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur, John Iadaola, Jimmy Dore, and Ben Mankiewicz of The Young Turks discuss the shooting of two cops and the claims by a St. Louis union official that the protesters in Ferguson want all of the cops to be dead after two police officers were shot.
Expired and gone to meet their maker, a stiff, bereft of life, resting in peace, metabolic processes are now history, off the twig, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleeding choir invisible; these are all descriptions for what the protesters in Ferguson want according to St. Louis police union official, and part time troll doll, Jeff Roorda.
Roorda claims come after multiple accounts of gunfire and violence against the police that are working crowd control against the protestors in Ferguson, Michigan. Following the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson, protesters arrived to protest the police department. The officers, clad in SWAT gear and other armor arrived to control the crowd. While the protest was winding down a few masked men in the crowd fired at the police, hitting two police officers seriously injuring them. DeRay Mckesson, one of the leaders of the protest, took to twitter to condemn the shooting, saying that the protesters as a group do not condone killing.”
Is Jeff Roorda right that the protesters want dead cops? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.
