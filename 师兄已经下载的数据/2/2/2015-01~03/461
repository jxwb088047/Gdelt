BANGKOK, March 3 (Reuters) - A Thai court will decide this
month whether to release 17 Uighurs from the western Chinese
region of Xinjiang, including 13 children, who have been
detained for the past 11 months in Bangkok, a lawyer for the
group said on Tuesday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in unrest in Xinjiang in
the past two years, prompting a crackdown by Chinese
authorities. Small numbers of Uighurs, a Muslim people from
Xinjiang who speak a Turkic language, have been trickling out of
China to Southeast Asia with some ending up in Thailand.
"The court will hold an urgent hearing on March 24 and
decide whether to release the group of 17, including a
four-month-old baby, who are all from the same family," Worasit
Piriyawiboon, a lawyer for the group, said.
"They would be released immediately if the court finds they
have been detained illegally."
Under Thai law, court approval must be sought for detention
periods over seven days.
The family, who use the surname Teklimakan, entered Thailand
in March 2014 and were caught in the town of Aranyaprathet,
close to Thailand's border with Cambodia.
They were charged with illegal entry and the adults fined
20,000 baht ($618), said Worasit. The family are currently being
held at Bangkok's Suan Plu Immigration Detention Center.
The Embassy of Turkey in Bangkok could not be reached for
comment.
China lashed out at Turkey in November for offering to
shelter roughly 200 Uighurs from Xinjiang who were rescued from
a human-smuggling camp in Thailand.
Turkey is home to thousands of Uighurs who have fled
Xinjiang since the Chinese Communists took over the region in
1949.
