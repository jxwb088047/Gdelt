4 terror suspects to go on trial in Indonesia | ABS-CBN News
JAKARTA - Four foreign suspected militants, who carry Turkish passports but are thought to be members of China's ethnic Uyghur minority, are among seven suspects who will go on trial in Indonesia within a month, their lawyer team said Tuesday.
Ashludin Hatjani, one of the lawyers, said the dossiers of his clients -- the four "Turkish" and three Indonesians -- have been completed and the police have handed the documents over to the North Jakarta Prosecutors' Office.
The seven have been charged under an article of the 2003 Antiterrorism Law for "having an intention to join" the Mujahidin Indonesia Timur group led by Santoso, who has been linked in the past to Jemaah Islamiyah, a militant group regarded as the Southeast Asian wing of the al-Qaida terror group.
Santoso is one of the most-wanted terrorist suspects in the country. Two years ago, he called for a "holy war" against the Indonesian counterterrorism police.
The suspected militants were arrested in September last year while on their way to the town of Poso in Central Sulawesi Province in central Indonesia, the alleged stronghold of the Santoso group.
"Our clients allegedly provided assistance to the Santoso group in the form of money or goods," Ashludin told Kyodo News.
Although the four foreign suspects possess Turkish passports, police believe that they are Uyghurs because they do not speak Turkish but use the Uyghur language and their passports were fake.
While both the Turkish and Chinese embassies in Jakarta have not recognized their nationality, the four will go on trial as Turks next month at the North Jakarta District Court.
If found guilty, the seven suspects would face life sentence.
Uyghur is a Muslim ethnic group of Turkish origin. In China, they mostly live in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where scores of violent incidents linked to separatist movements have been reported in recent years.
The mountainous areas of Sulawesi Island are known to be a magnet for Islamist radicals following sectarian conflict between Muslims and Christians in Poso.
A regency with a population of around 215,000, Poso was the scene of bloody clashes between Christians and Muslims that claimed about 1,000 lives and displaced 25,000 others between 1998 and 2001.
During the conflict, Jemaah Islamiyah sent preachers and military instructors, mostly trained on Mindanao Island in the southern Philippines, to assist the Muslim side.
A peace pact ended the conflict in 2001, but Islamic extremists affiliated with Jemaah Islamiyah continue to be active.
In December, Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno warned that at least 110 foreigners identified as Islamic State militants have been detected in Poso, a development he called "very worrying."
Tedjo also noted that hundreds of Indonesians, inspired by the Islamic State to fight in violence-torn Syria and Iraq, have joined or intend to join the extremist group.
