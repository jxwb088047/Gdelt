Now Chinese Muslims join ISIS in droves: Report : World, News - India Today
Chinese Muslims from the country's western region are travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside ISIS, a report said citing officials.
According to officials, Chinese Muslims are travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS before returning home to take part in plots against the communist rule.
Meanwhile, the authorities are planning to crackdown on terrorism in Xinjiang, home to the minority Uighur Muslims, some of whom want their own independent state.
But officials failed to provide any further details to back up their claims - although The Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in December about 300 Chinese are fighting alongside the Islamic State.
"There are Uighurs that have fled overseas and joined the Islamic State," the Mail online quoted Zhang Chunxian, Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, as saying on Tuesday.
"The organisation has a huge international influence and Xinjiang can't keep aloof from it and we have already been affected.
"We have also found that some who fought returned to Xinjiang to participate in terrorist plots," the report quoted the official as saying.
In the recent past, Xinjiang has seen repeated violence, as members of the Muslim Uighur have bristled under what they say is repressive Chinese government rule.
