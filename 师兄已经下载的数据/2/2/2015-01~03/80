China’s education minister has told universities to shun textbooks that promote Western values, state media say.
Yuan Guiren said universities should maintain political integrity and keep criticism of China’s leaders or political system out of the classroom.
His comments, reported by Xinhua news agency, came at an educational forum.
In recent months restrictions on academics appear to have been tightening.
In December, law professor Zhang Xuehong said he was sacked by the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai after refusing to apologise for writing articles criticising the government.
His dismissal followed the expulsion of outspoken economist and free speech advocate Xia Yeliang from Peking University in October.
Mr Xia was a signatory to a high-profile document calling for democratic reforms, Charter 08.
Prominent Uighur academic Ilham Tohti – who had urged better dialogue between Beijing and the Uighur minority in Xinjiang – was jailed for life for separatism last year. Several of his students were also jailed.
