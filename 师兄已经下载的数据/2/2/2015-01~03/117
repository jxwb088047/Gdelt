Chinese stampedes: A chronology | Zee News
At least 35 people have been killed and dozens injured in a stampede at New Year`s celebrations in Shanghai.
Though most large gatherings in China are carefully controlled by authorities, the country has seen other incidents in which overcrowding has caused panic and deaths.
Here is a brief chronology of other recent stampedes in China:
