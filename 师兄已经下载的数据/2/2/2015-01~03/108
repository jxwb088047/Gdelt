Farmer strikes gold after stumbling across 17-pound nugget worth £163,000 - Mirror Online
A shepherd struck lucky when he stumbled across a giant gold nugget thought to be worth £163,000.
The lucky herdsman, from a remote region of China, found the 17-pound lump lying on the ground.
It measured in at 23cms long and 18cms wide, and in local currency would be worth 1.6million yuan.
After making the discovery in the far western region of Xinjiang, Berek Sawut told local press that he found it "practically lying on the ground".
It is unclear however if the farmer will be able to keep his jackpot.
Chinese metal expert Zhu Xinfeng was quoted by the state news agency explaining that precious metal can fetch several times more if it comes in the form of a natural lump.
China is the world's biggest producer of gold, claiming the top spot eight years in a row.
