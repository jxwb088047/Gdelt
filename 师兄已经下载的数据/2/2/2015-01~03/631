In China\'s far western city of Urumqi (the capital of Xinjiang), the food becomes less Chinese and more Middle eastern. Here you find Muslim cuisine that shows just how diverse China really is. I was super lucky to try the lamb kebabs cooked on the street on my way back to Chengdu from Turkey.
Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

I had a quick layover on my way back home to Chengdu from Istanbul in Urumqi. There was only one thing to do, eat Xinjiang food and compare the Kebabs to the Turkish kebab that was still in my stomach from the night before. 

The total cost was 50 RMB ($7.87) for 3 awesome dishes: 

5 Huge lamb kebabs
4 huge steamed pumpkin baozi
and one massive rounang bun filled with juicy lamb and onion

All in all, the food here was super delicious, except for the lamb kebabs. Ironically, I came specifically to try them, but they ended up being the least delicious of the three. The rounang took the number one spot and was crowned the most delicious Xinjiang food I tried in my very very short stay in Urumqi.

China has increased security measures in Xinjiang following more clashes between police and members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic minority group that left dozens of people dead.
 
According to Chinese state media agency Xinhua, the clashes were a premeditated terrorist attack, but a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress said Uighurs were marching in protest against oppressive Chinese policies and restrictions during Ramadan, such as police breaking into Uighurs’ houses, making random arrests, holding detainees for interrogations, and brutally beating people on their way to the mosque. 

Clashes took place in Shache county, in the townships of Elixku and Huangdi. In Elixku, a group of assailants, wielding knives and axes, attacked a police station and government offices, the South China Morning Post reported. In the town of Huangdi, according to Xinhua, assailants damaged more than 30 police cars, burning six of them. 

Chinese police responded by shooting towards the crowd, killing dozens and leaving many wounded, Reuters reported. A spokesperson for the World Uighur Congress said 100 people were killed.

While Chinese media say violence was limited to the two towns, Uighurs say the violence also spread to Kashgar. There, a French tourist told Reuters he saw a dead body outside a mosque on Wednesday. According to the Guardian, the person found dead was a high profile Xinjiang imam who supported the Communist Party. 

The tourist told Reuters he saw armed police convoys entering the town and preventing civilians cars from coming in.

Raw footage of the deadly Uyghur terror attack on innocent civilians in Xinjiang China on 5 July 2009. You will never see this on CNN or BBC. Uyghur terrorists attacked and killed not only Han Chinese but also Hui Muslims and other innocent Uyghurs. These murderers killed 192 innocent people on that day. Uyghur terrorists used urban guerrilla tactics to kill innocent people and to evade police capture. They would quickly blend back into the community when the police came and pretending they were onlookers giving wrong infomation to confuse the police. Their aim is to stir up racial hatred in Xinjiang where many ethnic groups live. Now you can see it for yourself, is it really a \"peaceful\" Uyghur demonstration? See the Truth for yourself!...

Was the bloodshed in Xinjiang this week done by insurgents, rioters, or terrorists? It\'s hard to tell because Chinese state run media Xinhua has been constantly changing the story about the violence. But one this is clear, the Chinese regime really has issues with Xinjiang\'s Uighur Muslims. They\'ve co-opted the War on Terror language by calling the Muslims terrorists when really they\'re a whole lot more like Tibetans in Tibet. Ethnic tensions are high in Xinjiang between the ethnic Uighurs and Han Chinese. And the death toll is rising.

Xinjiang (XUAR) (Uyghur: شىنجاڭ‎, ULY: Shinjang; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕíntɕjɑ́ŋ]; Chinese: 新疆; pinyin: Xīnjiāng; Wade–Giles: Hsin1-chiang1; Postal map spelling: Sinkiang) is an autonomous region (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) of the People's Republic of China. It is the largest Chinese administrative division and spans over 1.6 million km2. Xinjiang borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing region.
It is home to a number of different ethnic groups including the Uyghur, Han, Kazakh, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Mongol. More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are located in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan, Sinkiang, and East Turkestan. Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.
