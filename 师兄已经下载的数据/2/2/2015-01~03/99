Who needs to take a gun grocery shopping? This woman probably wished she did when a deranged man grabbed her two year old daughter from her shopping cart and then held a knife to her throat.

Kudos to the pastor who used his cart to help corral the madman until men (and presumably women) with guns showed up to handle the situation.

Beckerman and Derek discuss the rumors that Richard Simmons is being held hostage in his home. Richard appeared on \"Today\" Monday via telephone, acknowledging he\'s dropped out of sight for years but he\'s ok. Click \'SHOW MORE\' for related content....

The New York Daily News did the latest story over the weekend -- that Richard\'s friends have been alarmed that he has shut down contact with them.
TMZ has reported over the last year-and-a-half, Richard has shut close, long-term friends out of his life. He doesn\'t acknowledge birthdays, deaths and various forms of outreach by people who love him.
As we reported, in January of last year the LAPD went to Simmon\'s home for a welfare check after a friend reported he was the subject of elder abuse. The LAPD cops say Simmons looked fine and was in good spirits.
You can hear in the \"Today\" interview ... he\'s dealing with issues.
