‘ME peace needed to defeat extremists’
STRASBOURG - King Abdullah II of Jordan warned Tuesday that an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal was essential for combating Islamic extremists, saying the conflict served as a rallying cry for militants. Abdullah told the European Parliament that the battle against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria was “first and foremost” a fight for Muslim nations to carry out.Jordan has stepped up its role in the US-led coalition against IS after the group burned to death a captured Jordanian military pilot in a grisly video released last month. But Abdullah said the root problem was the world’s failure to “defend Palestinian rights”. “This failure sends a dangerous message,” he said. “And it has given the extremists a powerful rallying cry. They exploit the injustices and the lingering conflict, to build legitimacy and recruit foreign fighters across Europe and the world.”He added: “How can we fight the ideological battle, if we do not chart the way forward towards Palestinian-Israeli peace?”As a country that has made peace with Israel, Jordan has played a mediating role in the peace process.Around 20,000 foreign fighters are believed to have left their homelands to join extremist groups in the past few years - including an estimated 4,000 since 2012 from western Europe.Abdullah however said that Muslim countries had to lead the fight against IS and other extremists.Introducing the king to European lawmakers, Parliament President Martin Schulz offered his sympathies over the murder of the pilot. “It’s hard to imagine people could commit such gruesome acts,” he said.Meanwhile, about 95 captives, including Kurdish fighters, escaped from an Islamic State-run prison in northern Syria but most have been recaptured, a monitoring group said on Tuesday.The jailbreak took place in the town of al-Bab, 30 km (20 miles) south of the Turkish frontier, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State controls tracts of territory across northern Syria and runs its own prisons, courts and other facilities in what it describes as an Islamic caliphate extending into Iraq.The escapees included Syrian civilians, about 30 Kurdish fighters, and members of Islamic battalions opposed to the more hardline Islamic State, the Observatory said. Kurdish fighters backed by US-led air strikes have been trying to drive back Islamic State across northern Syria.Islamic State has put the town on high alert and has been using loudspeakers to tell citizens to capture the escapees, the Observatory said, citing people on the ground. About two thirds have since been caught. “They have set up new checkpoints and have been searching houses,” the Observatory’s head Rami Abdulrahman said.Islamic State was still in control of the town, which lies northeast of the city of Aleppo. “But it shows some weakness when a big number of prisoners escapes,” he said.Islamic State combatants fought each other over the weekend in al-Bab when several of its members broke out of another jail in the town and tried to head for the Turkish border. Since that breakout, Islamic State had moved people to the new, smaller prison which was the site of the latest escape.The group which escaped over the weekend included mainly European fighters and was stopped by other Islamic State members in clashes that killed at least nine, the Observatory said. Meanwhile, the top Communist official in China’s Xinjiang said Tuesday that extremists from the mainly Muslim region have been apprehended after returning from fighting in Syria with the Islamic State group.Zhang Chunxian, party head in Xinjiang, told reporters that the radicals were caught when a terror plot was recently uncovered, reported the Global Times, which is affiliated with the ruling party mouthpiece People’s Daily.He said that they had returned to Xinjiang, the homeland of China’s Uighur ethnic minority, to participate in violent terror plots, the report said. He apparently gave no details, including the number of people apprehended. Other Chinese media carried similar reports, but did not specifically mention Syria.Meanwhile, Spanish police arrested two suspected militants Tuesday in Spain’s north African territory of Ceuta on charges of belonging to a group that was “prepared” to launch an attack on Spanish soil, the government said.“The national police at dawn this morning carried out an anti-terrorist operation which led to the detention in Ceuta of two suspected militants,” the interior ministry said in a statement.“They were part of a cell that was fully prepared and willing to carry out an attack on national territory,” it said.Tuesday’s police operation was linked to four other arrests in Ceuta on January 24, when officers detained two sets of Spanish brothers of Moroccan origin.In those January raids, police seized an automatic pistol, machetes and military uniforms. The government said those four suspects were highly trained and disposed to launch attacks in Spain.Tuesday’s statement said the two latest suspects were thought to be members of the same cell as the other four.A coastal city fenced off from northern Morocco, Ceuta has one of Europe’s only two land borders with Africa, along with another Spanish territory, Melilla, to the east.Spain’s government has announced raids on a series of suspected Islamist cells over recent months, most of them in Ceuta and Melilla.It says about 100 people from Spain are suspected of having joined militant fighters in Iraq and Syria and fears they may return to launch attacks.Hundreds more such radicals from France, Britain and Germany are also thought to have travelled to those countries to fight.
