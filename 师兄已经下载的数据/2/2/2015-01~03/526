Real names needed if you want fireworks- China.org.cn
People wanting to buy fireworks to celebrate the Chinese New Year in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will have to register using their real names this year, authorities said yesterday.
One of the aims of the rule, an extension of the one already in place in the capital, Urumqi, is to prevent terrorists obtaining raw materials for explosive devices, said Li Jianghui, an official with the region's work safety department.
However, he claimed it would also reduce safety risks caused by illegal firework outlets and poor quality fireworks.
The department has ordered all firework retail outlets to install a tracking system and record the type and quantity of products purchased by each customer.
Xinjiang has selected 19 official firework manufacturers from dozens across the country to sell products in the region this year, said Guo Zhirong, head of the regional fireworks industry association.
