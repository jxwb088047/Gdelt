Fighting terrorism in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is major topic of discussion at this year's two sessions.  NPC deputy and Chairman of Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Shohrat Zakir has highlighted the importance of upholding law and order.  "Over the past year, our regional government has received a wide range of support from the people,” he said.  “Even some relatives of identified terrorists have assisted the authorities in their investigations. Such campaigns may make the terrorists feel sorry for society and their families. The security situation for the entire region is completely under control. We've nipped many terrorists' plans in the bud. But we need to keep on alert for some extremist terrorist groups. But I believe that there will be fewer and fewer terrorist cases in the future."
