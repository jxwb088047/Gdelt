Xinjiang mulls subsidies for tourists
(ECNS) - The Tourist Administration of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has drafted a pilot plan to offer subsidies for tourists to visit the region, local news portal ts.cn reported on Thursday. 
In a bid to revitalize its tourist industry, the authority has promised a two million yuan subsidy (US$320,000), or about 200 yuan (US$32) per person, in the form of traveling cards for tourist groups of more than 16 people. 
The subsidies would be conditional on the travelling route covering any two of Xinjiang's seven highest rated scenic spots, or on travellers spending at least two nights in the region, according to the program. 
Declaration procedures should also be simplified and standardized to aid the convenience and benefit of more travellers, a member of staff at the travelling agency said. 
The plan will not only promote the tourism market in Xinjiang, but also speed up the construction of the Tourist Distribution Centre of the Silk Road Economic Belt, the report said. 
Xinjiang's Tourist Bureau launched a scheme in 2014 to welcome more tourists. The region received over 49.5 million tourists, with overall tourism revenues of 65 billion yuan (US$10.4 billion) that year. 
The autonomous region said that total tourism revenues would exceed 100 billion yuan (US$16.1 billion) in 2015.
