War and Peace: Iran\'s Nuclear Program (2009) - The story of Iran\'s nuclear program told from the other side.

For downloads and more information visit: http://www.journeyman.tv/?lid=67124&bid=2

Under pressure from finite fossil fuel reserves and scrutiny from the West, Iran\'s Nuclear program has had a difficult road. This is the story of Iranian nuclear energy told from the other side.

\"Iran has tried its best to have a pragmatic approach, not an ambitious approach\", claims the country\'s ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh. But are all such claims destined to fall on deaf ears? A climate of suspicion and hostility has historically smothered any meaningful discussion of Iran\'s right to nuclear technologies. The West accuse Iran of creating a \'confidence deficit\' by pursuing a clandestine programme of enrichment; Iran sense hypocrisy, and claim to be singled out. \"There are similar cases with Taiwan, with Egypt, with Brazil, and all of these countries get away with it.\" Ultimately, all parties acknowledge that a system that enshrines the right of the powerful to bend the rules is unsustainable. \"The whole of the non-proliferation regime has elements of double-standards built into it\", concedes David Hannay, a member of the House of Lords. But will this consensus signal a move beyond the rhetoric to purposeful negotiation? \"Iran has an opportunity to become the good boy of the world.\"

After 42 hours overtime, the Iran nuclear negotiations with the United States, Russia, China, France, Great Britain and Germany reached a framework deal in Lausanne, Switzerland. In return for lifting the sanctions, which means more than $110 billion a year relief for Tehran and a return to the global economic market, Iran will be significantly constrained in its nuclear programme. This is the framework agreement, meaning the formal deal will be signed before July 1st. Over the next three months, the technical details will have to be worked out, but what does the Iranian nuclear deal really mean?

The Russian president has criticized the US for continuing to develop its missile system despite the fact that the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program has been solved.

Vladimir Putin said the reason that spurred the US to build its missile system is gone, but Washington continues to develop the program. He said the US cheated the whole world over Iran’s nuclear program and now the whole world is being misled once again. Putin was speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. Elsewhere in his remarks, he said Iran and some other regional countries should be part of the efforts aimed at resolving the crisis in Syria. Putin added that he is confident that his country’s military action in Syria will help end the crisis and restore peace in the war-torn nation.

Over the summer of 2012, despite increased international pressure and economic sanctions, Iran doubled the number of nuclear centrifuges installed in its underground Fordow site, stopping just short of the capacity to produce nuclear fuel. President Obama has rejected Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s call to draw a \"red line\" that would trigger U.S. military action. But what would the costs and benefits of military action be? Can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, or could the time be near for a pre-emptive strike?

The nuclear program of Iran was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Iran's nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the Shah of Iran.
After the 1979 revolution, the Iranian government temporarily disbanded elements of the program, and then revived it with less Western assistance than during the pre-revolution era. Iran's nuclear program has included several research sites, two uranium mines, a research reactor, and uranium processing facilities that include three known uranium enrichment plants.
After delays, Iran's first nuclear power plant, Bushehr I reactor was complete with major assistance of Russian government agency Rosatom and officially opened on 12 September 2011. Iran has announced that it is working on a new 360 MW nuclear power plant to be located in Darkhovin. Iran has also indicated that it will seek more medium-sized nuclear power plants and uranium mines in the future.
