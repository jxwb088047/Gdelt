Conservative Blogger Hates Spock... Because Of Obama
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 6, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, John Iadaola, and Desi Doyan of The Young Turks discuss the Washington Free Beacon’s Matthew Continetti and his dislike of the Star Trek Character Spock or Leonard Nimoy because of the opinions on the character by President Obama.
With the passing of Leonard Nimoy at the age of 83 many fans of his original Star Trek series character Spock held moments of silence, screens of Trek films and words of tribute and admiration for a fictional character that championed logic above all else. One of the few that openly mocked the death of the actor is Washington Free Beacon editor in chief Matthew Continetti.
In a blog post titled ‘I Don’t Love Spock’, Continetti points out that Obama enjoys the character because the President can see a lot of himself in the fictional character. Using this as a launching point of attack, Continetti forms a fan theory around the character, painting the crew member of the USS Enterprise as a selfish self centered terrible role model. Continetti uses this as a way to create a strawman argument around how the President conducts himself, basically ending the blog post painting both Spock and Obama as Ayn Rand’s wet dream, provided they were industrialist trying to build railroads in the nineteen fifties.”
Is Spock a good role model or not? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.
