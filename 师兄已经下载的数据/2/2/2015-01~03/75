Who Is ISIS Trying To Recruit Now?
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 31, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the discovery of a new ISIS recruitment tapes aimed at an interesting demographic.
Many of asked what would lead Americans, British, or other Westerners to join terrorist group ISIS and now the answer may have been found. It seems ISIS or ISIL uses video and other propaganda on the internet to recruit young men and women from first world countries to its cause. The videos offer valuable incentives to ‘freedom fighters’ and their allies such as free housing, all the while looking like a cool action movie trailer. It has been compared to methods that cults use with their propaganda to draw extra members. Some fear that if governments and policymakers don’t take notice of these recruitment tactics that it could become a serious problem in the not too distant future.”
