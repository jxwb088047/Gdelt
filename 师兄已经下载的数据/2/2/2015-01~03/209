Cenk Uygur isn’t letting Christians off the hook for slavery — no matter what Tucker Carlson says
Young Turks host Cenk Uygur dismantled Fox News contributor Tucker Carlson’s argument that Christianity had wiped slavery out in the U.S.
“The reality is, it wasn’t just the Klan after slavery,” Uygur said. “It wasn’t just all the lynchings and the Jim Crow days after slavery. It was Christianity and the Bible that justified slavery in this country.”
On Sunday, Carlson joined the many conservatives complaining about President Barack Obama’s remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, saying Obama compared the religion to the Islamic State terrorist group.
“Who ended slavery and Jim Crow? Christians. The Rev. Martin Luther King. Christians,” Carlson said at the time. “Christianity is the reason we don’t have slavery in the world today. I mean, talk about ahistorical.”
While many religions have justified slavery, Uygur said on Monday, it was definitely Christians who used their scripture in the U.S., pointing out several Biblical passages allowing for not only the buying of slaves from “resident foreigners,” but the purchase of those residents’ children.
“You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance,” Uygur said, quoting from the book of Leviticus.
While Carlson and other conservatives have argued that Christians ended slavery in the U.S. Uygur called the notion “ridiculous.”
“What happened, the Muslims moved to Georgia and Alabama and did slavery?” Uygur asked sarcastically. He also showed a picture from a Ku Klux Klan gathering expressly representing their religious beliefs:
“Look at that — it says ‘Jesus Saves,'” Uygur exclaimed. “How’s that for a nice Christian picture?”
