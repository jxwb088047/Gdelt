Xinjiang remains stable despite terror attacks: officials - Xinhua | English.news.cn
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has remained stable despite terror attacks, a senior official said Tuesday.
"Violent terror attacks have provoked strong condemnation and opposition in the region," said Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government, during the ongoing annual session of the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature.
With the concerted efforts of all ethnic groups, violent terrorism was dealt with in accordance with law, he said.
"A number of violent terrorist attacks were thwarted," he said.
He lauded the relatives of identified terrorists that had assisted the authorities in their investigations.
Che Jun, deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Xinjiang regional committee, said about 95 percent of potential attacks in Xinjiang had been stopped thanks to public reports.
"It shows that terrorism is the enemy of all the people in Xinjiang," Che said.
Education to maintain stability has also been enhanced, with solutions related to ideas, culture, convention or religion, Shohrat Zakir said.
Zhang Chunxian, the CPC chief of the region, said Xinjiang Police had contributed to the stability of the entire country.
Of the number of the country's police who had died during service last year, 31 percent were from the Xinjiang police, he said.
