United Arab Emirates carrier Air Arabia will enter the Chinese market by launching non-stop services next week.
Starting on Feb 10, Air Arabia will fly three times weekly from its main hub in Sharjah to Urumqi, capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Flights will depart Sharjah in the morning on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday and arrive at Urumqi that evening. Return flights will leave the Chinese city later on the same day.
The new service will be operated by Airbus A320 aircraft, offering 166 economy seats.
Air Arabia will become the first low-cost airline from the Middle East and North Africa to enter the Chinese market.
"We have had our eyes on the Chinese market for some time and are now ready to begin regular services to one of the world's great economies," said CEO Adel Ali.
