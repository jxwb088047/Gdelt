Bill O'Reilly's bestselling book "Killing Jesus" is more than a history book about the shocking events which led up to the execution of the most influential man who ever walked the face of the earth. The brilliance of Jesus is revealed in the Fox news anchor's masterpiece which presents strong evidence as to why 2.2 billion people believe he is God almost two thousand years...
“I do not sit with deceitful men, nor do I consort with hypocrites” (Psalms 26:4). When my wife and I first met, it didn’t take long for me to realize that her faith was very important to her. “You’re pretty religious, aren’t you,” I asked her on our first date. I’ll never forget her answer: “No, I’m not religious at all. I’m a Christian.” I couldn’t understand why she had a...
Actually, I seriously dislike the words religion and religious. First, there is no such thing as generic religiosity. There are Christians and Jews and Muslims and Hindus. No one practises religion, as such. And second, precisely because the word "religion" describes the common outward format...
Prior to the converting Light on the road to Damascus, Saul was a 'type' of terrorist we see today. He received religious endorsement, and went on a campaign to persecute and imprison Christians, ultimately to destroy Christianity. He truly believed he was doing the Will of God. In an instant, however, the Light of Christ converted this man from an anti-Christian par...
Every story has a bad guy -- a villain of some kind. And most people familiar with the story of Jesus will label the Pharisees as the "bad guys" who attempted to derail His life and ministry. As we'll see below, this is mostly true. However, it's also possible that the Pharisees as a whole have been given a bad wrap they don't entirely deserve.Who Were the Pharisees? Modern...
EVANGELIST Matthew gives this account of what happened on Innocents Day: “After they had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.’ So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his...

\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that anybody who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"

The Gospel (good news) of our salvation is this:

Jesus Christ is many things to many people. He is easily THE MOST influential figure in human history. His words and actions changed the course and nature of the society in which he lived, as well as the world at large. Today, over 2 billion people name his name as their savior. It is difficult to imagine what the world would have looked like had he not come and shown us all how to love one another. His example sits in the back of all of our minds, whether we realize it or not.

In a time where so many of us focus on the evil and wicked things of the world (myself included) where \'wrong\' seems to be the new \'right\', it is so easy for us to forget why we embarked on this journey to begin with... So let us listen carefully to the powerful words spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ. Words full of Love, Truth, Wisdom and Life. And let us live as beacons of light and hope, in a world full of darkness.

It has become a common occurrence over the years for Muslims in the Middle East who have converted to Christianity to claim to have been compelled to do so after dreaming of a person who they believe is Jesus Christ. Now, one militant belonging to the brutal Islamic State that has massacred Christians has converted to his victims\' religion after dreaming of \"a man in white\" with a startling message, according to one missionary\'s account.

\"One of our YWAM workers in the Middle East was contacted by a friend earlier this year and they met up and he was introduced to an ISIS fighter who had killed many Christians already. I mean that\'s a horrible situation, and admittedly, he was probably on guard,\" Gina Fadely, director of Youth With A Mission Frontier Missions, Inc. (YWAM), said during a recent appearance on The Voice of the Martyrs Radio Network.

YWAM, a nonprofit missionary organization active since 1960, describes itself as \"a global movement of Christians from many cultures, age groups, and Christian traditions, dedicated to serving Jesus throughout the world.\" The Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) is another nonprofit that draws attention to Christians facing persecution around the world.

Fadely, who appeared on the VOM radio program along with Kevin Sutter, another YWAM leader, went on to share that this Islamic State jihadi confessed not only to killing Christians but \"that he had actually enjoyed doing so.\"

Jesus ( /ˈdʒiːzəs/; Greek: Ἰησοῦς; 7–2 BC/BCE to 30–36 AD/CE), also referred to as Jesus Christ or simply Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and most Christian denominations venerate him as God the Son incarnated. In Islam, Jesus (in Arabic: عيسى‎ in Islamic usage, commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets.
Most modern historians agree that Jesus existed and was a Jewish teacher from Galilee in Roman Judaea, who was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of the Roman Prefect, Pontius Pilate. Scholars have offered competing descriptions and portraits of Jesus, which at times share a number of overlapping attributes, such as a rabbi, a charismatic healer, the leader of an apocalyptic movement, a self-described Messiah, a sage and philosopher, or a social reformer who preached of the "Kingdom of God" as a means for personal and egalitarian social transformation. Scholars have correlated the New Testament accounts with non-Christian historical records to arrive at an estimated chronology of Jesus' life.
