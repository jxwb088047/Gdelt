For more than six weeks, nine countries led by Saudi Arabia have been carrying out airstrikes on Yemen, the Arab world\'s poorest nation. Whole neighborhoods have been destroyed and communities reduced to rubble. 

According to the United Nations, the strikes, targeting Iranian-backed Houthi rebel positions in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, have killed over 1,400 people, many of them civilians.

With international media unable to enter the besieged capital, Yousef Mawry, a local journalist, recorded the devastation of his home city for VICE News. He meets the survivors and victims, getting the inside view of life in Yemen.

Since 2011, when Yemeni youths took to the streets and sparked the eventual demise of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh\'s regime, the country has fallen to pieces. The new embattled government is now struggling to cope with a bevy of issues, including sectarian rivalries, CIA drone strikes, and one of al Qaeda\'s most sophisticated branches. It now risks presiding over the failure of one of the world\'s most fragile countries.

In \"Yemen: A Failed State,\" VICE News visits some of Yemen\'s most dangerous and hard-to-reach places and groups, including the national Army in the country\'s lawless East, the Houthis in Sana\'a, and the Popular Committee in the South, to find out how both the government and the West\'s policy toward Yemen have gone wrong.

The Youngest Bride: Renewed calls to end to Yemen\'s child brides

For downloads and more information visit: http://www.journeyman.tv/65997/short-films/the-youngest-bride.html

The story of Nujood Ali, a young girl married off at 8 then raped and beaten by her husband, shocked the international community recently. But child marriage remains a legal and common practise in Yemen.

\"He sexually assaulted me on the wedding night. His mother was holding me,\" remembers Nujood. Traumatised, she sought refuge from her relatives but was turned away for fear of shaming the family. With no one to rely on but herself, she took a taxi to court where a judge, outraged by her story, granted her a divorce. But Nujood was lucky in a country which does not recognise marital rape as a crime and has no minimum marriage age. A reform to introduce it was blocked last year by Yemen\'s Muslim Brotherhood. \"Islam doesn\'t specify an age for marriage. Why make a problem out of nothing?\" asks one member of Yemen\'s parliament. Nujood is set on fighting child marriage in Yemen when she grows up; but with an estimated half of all brides aged below 18 and many families hoping to alleviate poverty with dowries, she faces a bitter struggle.

In a previous CaspianReport, released back in 2011, we argued about the likelihood of a civil war in Yemen and that the Iranian back Houthi rebellion would trigger a new front in the ongoing Saudi-Iranian cold war. The other fronts being Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Now that Yemen is once again on the brink of civil war, and facing a Zaidi-Shia led uprising in the North and an al-Qaeda led uprising in the South, all the while being bombed by neighboring Arab states, let’s take a step back and look at the origins of the current crisis.

The commander-in-chief of Blackwater mercenaries in Yemen, a Mexican national was killed in clashes with Houthi Ansarullah fighters and allied forces in the Ta\'izz Province on Wednesday. According to the reports, the recent fatality has brought to 15 the number of foreign forces with the Blackwater killed in clashes in Yemen since Tuesday. The mercenaries are part of the UAE forces that help Saudi Arabia in its intervention in Yemen.

Yemeni security officials say governor of the embattled southern province of Aden has been assassinated after his convoy came under a rocket-propelled grenade attack. The incident took place when Jaafar Mohammed Saad was travelling with his entourage in the Tawahi district of the port city on Sunday. They said several members of his convoy also died in the act of terror. 

Some 1,500 Moroccan soldiers will be dispatched to Yemen to participate in the Saudi aggression against the Arab country. According to the reports, the troopers will assist Saudi soldiers in ground operations against Yemen. We remember, in October, about 6,000 Sudanese forces entered Yemens southern port city of Aden to join Saudi soldiers. Emirati, Bahraini and Qatari soldiers are also participating in the Saudi operations. 

Warring factions in Yemen are preparing to observe a week-long truce from December 15 while UN-mediated ...

The Republic of Yemen (Arabic: الجمهورية اليمنية‎ al-Jumhūrīyah al-Yamanīyah), commonly known as Yemen i/ˈjɛmən/ (Arabic: اليَمَن‎ al-Yaman), is a country located in Western Asia, occupying the southwestern to southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, and Oman to the east. Yemen is considered one of the poorest countries in the Arab world. Its capital and largest city is Sana'a. Yemen's territory includes over 200 islands, the largest of which is Socotra, about 415 km (258 mi) to the south of mainland Yemen, off the coast of Somalia. It is the only state in the Arabian Peninsula to have a purely republican form of government. Approximately 53% of Yemenis are Sunnis, while 45% are Zaydi Shias.
One etymology derives Yemen from yamin, meaning "on the right side", as the south is on the right when facing the sunrise. Another derives Yemen from yumn, meaning "felicity", as the region is fertile. The Romans called it Arabia Felix (Happy Arabia) as opposed to Arabia Deserta (Deserted Arabia), which was their term for northern Arabia.
