Mako and Paris & Simo are in the same title once again. This time with an amazing edit of one of my favorite Mako tracks \"Way Back Home\". The original Way Back Home sounded more like this when it was first created a few years ago - happy to hear that Paris & Simo brought life to that version. Hope you all enjoy! :)

Today, the person suspected of planning the Paris terrorist attack has been caught. Salah Abdeslam was captured in a raid by Belgian law enforcement. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, and Maz Jobrani (Jimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Salah Abdeslam, the 26-year-old fugitive suspected of carrying out the November terrorist attacks in Paris, was shot and arrested during a counter-terrorism raid in Belgium on Friday. CNN reports Abdeslam was captured alive.

\"We\'ve got him,\" Théo Brancken, Belgium\'s secretary of state for asylum and migration posted shortly after news of Abdeslam\'s arrest broke.

Earlier on Friday, police revealed they had recently discovered traces of Abdeslam\'s DNA inside an apartment in Brussels. His arrest is a major development for authorities trying to piece together the international terror network that supplied and inspired the attacks. Abdeslam is the only person among the ten individuals believed to have been directly involved in the coordinated attacks to survive, the New York Times reports.”*

Paris (i/ˈpærɨs/; French: [paʁi] ( listen)) is the capital and largest city of France. It is situated on the river Seine, in northern France, at the heart of the Île-de-France region (or Paris Region, French: Région parisienne). As of January 2008 the city of Paris, within its administrative limits (the 20 arrondissements) largely unchanged since 1860, has an estimated population of 2,211,297 and a metropolitan population of 12,089,098, and is one of the most populated metropolitan areas in Europe. Paris was the largest city in the Western world for about 1,000 years, prior to the 19th century, and the largest in the entire world between the 16th and 19th centuries.
Paris is today one of the world's leading business and cultural centres, and its influences in politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities. It hosts the headquarters of many international organizations such as UNESCO, the OECD, the International Chamber of Commerce or the European Space Agency. Paris is considered one of the greenest and most liveable cities in Europe. It is also one of the most expensive.
