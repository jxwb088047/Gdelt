On April 25, 2014, with the push of a button, Flint, Michigan, transitioned from the clean drinking water system they had been using for decades to drawing water from the toxic Flint River. Why would the city of Flint begin sourcing their water from what is known to be one of the most polluted rivers in the state? The switch was not made willingly. Flint, like Detroit and other...
The Environmental Protection Agency is under fire following revelations that the regulator knew about the potential lead toxicity of Flint, Michigan’s water supply system as early as April of last year, but did not alert the public and instead engaged in a six-month, behind-the-scenes power struggle with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality over whether chemical...

The complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in...
Flint is just the latest example of racism spurring environmental injustice. Structural racism is deadly, and not just because of police shootings of unarmed black youth. Environmental racism—disproportionate exposure to pollution and toxicity—is a slower, more insidious form of violence against low-income communities of color. The term “environmental racism” was coined in the...
Michael Moore holds some extreme views, and, he\'s not someone with whom I always agree. But he\'s right on the money, in this case. Governor Rick Snyder, and his cronies, lied to the people of the Flint, Michigan - making fun of the scientists who said people were being poisoned - while encouraging folks to keep drinking the poison water. This was water that Snyder\'s personally appointed \"emergency manager\" had decided should be piped to residents of Flint, as a cost-cutting measure (water from the terribly polluted Flint River). This is a screen capture, from MSNBC. I moved from Flint 3 years ago. 50 years ago, my father used to laugh at the people who would fish in the Flint River and, then, eat the fish. Snyder should be removed from office - and possibly go to jail....

As the tragedy of the Flint water-contamination crisis leaks out to the world, Gov. Rick Snyder and his staff have worked hard to downplay, spin, ignore and outright lie about the problems, which stem from disastrous choices by the state and the governor\'s emergency manager appointee. This short film by the ACLU of Michigan exposes the truth behind Snyder\'s waffling, the emergency manager\'s horrific decision to abandon clean water provided by Detroit in favor of using the corrosive Flint River as the city\'s water source....

“The emergency manager for Flint, Michigan, appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder in 2012, rejected using the city’s river as drinking water after consulting with the state’s environmental protection agency.

Snyder appointed Ed Kurtz to be Flint’s second emergency manager and Kurtz selected Jerry Ambrose to be the city’s chief financial officer. Both men were tasked by the Republican governor’s administration with restructuring the city’s government to save money after it was in danger of becoming insolvent. One cost-saving measure considered was to quit buying municipal water from Detroit.

In a civil deposition not reported until now, Ambrose testified under oath that emergency manager Kurtz considered a proposal to use the Flint River, discussed the option with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and then rejected it.”

Two environmental disasters are putting the livelihoods of scores of residents in jeopardy. The governor of Michigan asked President Obama to impose a “state of emergency” over the lead in the city of Flint’s water supply, while in California a methane gas leak continues at a small ranch, which is being investigated by federal officials for likely air and water pollution. RT’s Lindsay France is joined by Brigida Santos in Washington, DC and Manila Chan from California to look at these crises.
