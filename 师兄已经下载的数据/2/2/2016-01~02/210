Obama Issues Gun Control Executive Order - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 6, 2016Leave a Comment
President Obama is set to enact a number of new gun control regulations by executive order in the near future. He held a press conference to announce some of the new laws. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to consider what he can do without congressional legislation to reduce gun violence in America, which kills many more people in the US than other developed nations. In a press conference after the meeting, White House officials announced a plan they had been working on for months behind the scenes to address gun violence.
The changes attempt to tighten — but don’t close — what’s widely (but misleadingly) known as the “gun show loophole,” as well as increase the efficiency of the federal background check system to avoid cases from falling through. The executive actions will also take smaller steps, ranging from improving the tracking of lost or stolen guns to encouraging technological improvements that will, in theory, make firearms safer.”*
