\"Fox News host Megyn Kelly laid out evidence supporting what a disbelieving Bill O\'Reilly called the \"white privilege theory\" Monday night to explain why the black community in Ferguson, Mo. feels justice won\'t be served in the Michael Brown shooting.

Kelly ran down a list of statistics, including the disparity in employment between blacks and whites in Ferguson and that blacks are three times as likely as whites to be subjected to or threatened with force by police.

O\'Reilly then challenged those numbers, claiming Attorney General Eric Holder really held the reins in the investigation into the fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer.\"* The Young Turks hosts Ana Kasparian and Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies) break it down.

There is a silver lining to all the Donald Trump madness. Did you ever think in a million years that Fox News would be defending Muslims? Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"“I disagree,” Trump replied. “People have to be vetted. This is about security, it’s not about religion, and we cannot allow people to come into this country who have horrible things in their minds.”

When O’Reilly tendered that “I don’t think you have thought through the unintended consequences of banning an entire religion from coming to the United States,” the ever-humble Trump replied, “I have thought through everything, believe me.”

Trump later said that Islamic extremism is “a very, very serious problem, and somebody had to bring it up. Maybe it’s not politically correct to do it, but somebody had to bring it up. And a lot of people are very thankful I did it.””*

Bill O’Reilly has forced our hand. We have to talk about his personal life to point out some massive hypocrisy. This guy has spent years lecturing black people about family values and broken homes. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"A New York appeals court held last week that Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s school-age children don’t want to live with him anymore, and should live exclusively with their mother, O’Reilly’s ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy.

The lengthy decision affirms the holding of a Nassau County Supreme Court justice last year that the children, now aged 13 and 17, should live full-time with their mother (the former couple had been splitting residential custody). As we reported at the time, O’Reilly appealed that ruling, thereby delaying its enforcement (and, of course, extending his multi-front battle against McPhilmy and her new family).”*

Bill O’Reilly has forced our hand. We have to talk about his personal life to point out some massive hypocrisy. This guy has spent years lecturing black people about family values and broken homes. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"A New York appeals court held last week that Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s school-age children don’t want to live with him anymore, and should live exclusively with their mother, O’Reilly’s ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy.

The lengthy decision affirms the holding of a Nassau County Supreme Court justice last year that the children, now aged 13 and 17, should live full-time with their mother (the former couple had been splitting residential custody). As we reported at the time, O’Reilly appealed that ruling, thereby delaying its enforcement (and, of course, extending his multi-front battle against McPhilmy and her new family).”*

Bill O’Reilly really went on a tear against critics of Donald Trump on the left and the right for calling him a fascist and likening his rise to the rise of Adolf Hitler‘s.

O’Reilly said Trump has stepped in as an “avenger” for everyday Americans “promising to stop the madness and giving blunt voice to millions.” He declared Trump’s rise has “nothing to do with fascism, everything to do with furious dissent.”

And while he admitted there’s some darkness happening within the Trump campaign, “charges of racism and fascism are easy smears,” O’Reilly said, designed to stifle freedom of expression.

Oh, but if you think O’Reilly is opposed to comparing anyone to Nazis, you’d be wrong, because he explained to Bernie Goldberg why Trump critics saying those above things are acting like the Nazis:

 
“It’s funny, because the people who are doing this, they’re using techniques that the Nazis used. By them calling Trump a Nazi and his supporters little brownshirts, they’re doing the same thing that Goebbels… and all of those boys did, because they demonized the Jews, the intellectuals, the communists, the gypsies, the homosexuals. They demonized them in a way to try to get anger on the part of the German population towards those groups. It’s the same thing that those in America are doing to try to get anger toward Trump and his followers.”

William James "Bill" O'Reilly, Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American television host, author, syndicated columnist and political commentator. He is the host of the political commentary program The O'Reilly Factor on the Fox News Channel, which is the most watched cable news television program on American television. During the late 1970s and 1980s, he worked as a news reporter for various local television stations in the United States and eventually for CBS News and ABC News. From 1989 to 1995, he was anchor of the entertainment news program Inside Edition.
O'Reilly is widely considered a conservative commentator, though some of his positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy (in particular his opposition to the death penalty, and support for gun control and the environment.). O'Reilly is a registered "Independent" (See: Political views of Bill O'Reilly), and characterizes himself as a "traditionalist". O'Reilly is the author of ten books, and hosted The Radio Factor until early 2009.
