Seth Wenig / AP The politics of gun control are shifting. Democrats have long feared that loudly advocating for stricter gun laws, and attacking the gun lobby, would cost them elections.

President Obama is set to enact a number of new gun control regulations by executive order in the near future. He held a press conference to announce some of the new laws. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to consider what he can do without congressional legislation to reduce gun violence in America, which kills many more people in the US than other developed nations. In a press conference after the meeting, White House officials announced a plan they had been working on for months behind the scenes to address gun violence.

The changes attempt to tighten — but don\'t close — what\'s widely (but misleadingly) known as the \"gun show loophole,\" as well as increase the efficiency of the federal background check system to avoid cases from falling through. The executive actions will also take smaller steps, ranging from improving the tracking of lost or stolen guns to encouraging technological improvements that will, in theory, make firearms safer.”*

If there has ever been a speech that everyone needs to see regarding Obama\'s plan to take our guns. This is the one! In this clip we see an army vet that serves as a police officer speak to the motion to repeal the \'Safe\' act at the Dutchess County Legislature New York State. His name is Aaron Weiss and he has quite a bit say. At some points he even tears up. It isn\'t until he speaks on his friend\'s passing away in war that his emotions get the best of him. We love what this young man has to say to the administration and their plans for disarming our citizens!...

Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman recently said that he will not enforce any new gun laws that he believes are unconstitutional. Sheriff Peyman told Fox News on Monday that the U.S. Constitution is \"like the Bible\" because \"you either believe it or you don\'t.\"
Sheriff Peyman said: \"I swore an oath to the Constitution. And in the Constitution is the Second Amendment and that\'s what this country is based upon. How can I rightfully in my own mind and in my heart come in and take guns away from people when that is their protection?\" 
\"If you take out part, it\'s kind of like the Bible, either you believe it or you don\'t believe it. The Constitution, either you believe it or you don\'t. Either you live by it or you don\'t.\"

When asked how he would protect Americans from gun violence, Sheriff Peyman said: \"The Second Amendment, the way it was designed was to protect the people. In protection, it\'s just like if I\'m a bad guy and I\'m going to go kick a door but I know that the guy behind that door has a gun, and I go to this other door where I know a guy doesn\'t have a gun, that\'s the door I\'m going to kick.\"

\"You\'re still going to have incidences, you\'re still going to have violence. You\'re not going to be able to curb that, but the innocent people are going to be able to protect themselves.\"...

What is the Gun Control about? 

This video will give you an idea of why the \"powers that be\" are constantly staging shootings in America to pass more stricter gun laws. (This is just the beginning).

The owners of America (Illuminati) don\'t really care THAT much that so many Americans are armed because they know that most people will surrender to their new world order dictatorship without a fight. 

But it will make their process towards full control and enslavement easier if less people have assault rifles. When they send their agents to search american homes (like in the movie Equilibrium), they would obviously rather not meet armed opposition and have a shoot-out. Many Americans will rather die fighting than surrender without a fight only to be sent off to the FEMA concentration camps.

I suggest everyone watches \"Illuminazi\" by Anthony J. Hilder. Will give you more knowledge about this specific matter....

Gun politics in the United States has long been among the most controversial issues in American politics. For the last several decades, the debate regarding both the restriction and availability of firearms within the United States has been characterized by a stalemate between an individual right to bear arms based on the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and the responsibility of government to prevent crime, maintain order and protect the wellbeing of its citizens. In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment protects the right of an individual to own a firearm for the purposes of self defense within the home, while at the same time reaffirming the constitutionality of a wide range of long standing gun control laws. Repeated polling has found that a majority of Americans believe the constitution ensures their right to own a gun, and a majority also supports stricter enforcement of current laws. However, only 43 percent believe new laws would be more effective than better enforcement of existing laws in reducing gun violence in the United States.
