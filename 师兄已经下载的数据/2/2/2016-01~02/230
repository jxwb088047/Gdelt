Authorities in the United States are asking for Turkey to release two Vice journalists who have been imprisoned on unfounded allegations that they were working with ISIS and Kurdish militants. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian (The Point), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s presidency, Turkish journalists have increasingly been badgered, intimidated, threatened, and punished. Now, however, the Turkish government is going after two foreign journalists.

Britons Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, working for Vice News, were originally detained in southeast Turkey, along with a translator and a driver, for not having proper identification. But now they’re being accused of “engaging in terror activity” and having connections to ISIS.”*

Four Americans have been arrested in Bahrain for entering the country using false information and allegedly participating in \"attacks on police,\" according to a police statement released Monday.

The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain said it was \"aware of the arrest of four U.S. citizens in Bahrain\" on Sunday but provided no further comment because of privacy concerns.

All four Americans, including one female, entered the country between February 11 and 12, providing false information that they were tourists, the Bahrain Interior Ministry said.

The Americans\' presence coincided with rallies marking the fifth anniversary of Bahrain\'s 2011 uprising.

Bahrain is a small island nation with a predominantly Shiite population ruled by a Sunni minority. Sunday\'s demonstrations took place in, Sitra, a predominantly Shiite neighborhood south of the capital, Manama, known for sporadic protests since the 2011 pro-reform movement inspired by the Arab Spring.

Bahrain has arrested four US citizens accusing them of “illegal activities” such as attacking security forces, reported the country’s interior ministry. The detained appear to be journalists who had been covering the anniversary of the 2011 Bahraini uprising.
“The General Director of Capital Governorate Police announced on Monday the arrest of four US nationals,” the ministry’s statement said, adding that one of them was female.

According to the statement, one of the arrestees “participated in attacks on the police officers” wearing a mask during the “riots” that broke out in Bahrain’s capital of Manama on Sunday. Anti-government protesters had been marking the fifth anniversary of a violently suppressed uprising which happened in in 2011. It ended in clashes with police.Three more US citizens were later arrested at a security checkpoint in the same area. According to the General Director, all four detainees violated the country’s rules by providing false information on the purpose of their visit and claiming they were tourists as they entered Bahrain “between February 11 and 12.”

The ministerial statement also says that “at least some of the arrestees were in the country as members of the international media” adding that they had not registered with the relevant authorities and obtained media visas, providing no further details about their identities or about the organizations they work for.

According to AP, all four US citizens were journalists covering the anniversary of Bahrain’s 2011 uprising while they were working in the Sitra village not far from the Bahraini cap...

Two CNN producers were arrested on Tuesday after failing epically to sneak onto the One World Trade Center site in the Big Apple. Their detainment came a day after four daredevils turned themselves in for parachuting off the 1,776-foot tall building last September, and one week after a 16-year-old boy snuck all the way to the top of America\'s tallest building during the night and posted selfies. 

According to a CNN spokeswoman, producers Yon Pomrenze and Connor Boals were on assignment to cover the story of WTC break-ins, but they were not instructed to trespass the premise. Police said that they may have wanted to prove the point that it\'s very easy to break through security. As such, on Tuesday sometime after lunch, Pomrenze and Boals walked along the WTC fences, and attempted to go into a partially opened gate at Veser and Washington. 

After being rebuffed by police, the pair walked east and reached the PATH station entrance, where Boals allegedly climbed the fence twice to try to break in. The journalists were stopped by police and security again. They next walked further east, finally reaching Veser and Church, where they allegedly tried to force their way into a gate. 

The PAPD told Reuters the pair said if a 16-year-old could get on the site, they should also be able to get in. The cop added that however, \"[The teenager] had enough sense to try it at 4 o\'clock in the morning.\"

The two men were arrested and booked on criminal trespass, obstruction of governmental administration, and disorderly conduct charges. Better luck next time....

Media watchdogs and rights advocates called on Hong Kong police to stop harassing human rights observers in the region. It came after police removed a rights worker and arrested one of our interns at NTD\'s Hong Kong bureau during the annual July 1st protest marking Hong Kong\'s return to China.

On Tuesday, Hong Kong and international rights groups criticized the police for handling journalists and a rights worker unfairly during the July 1st protest. 

[Milabel Cristobal Amar, Director of Amnesty International, HK Section]: 
\"We want to reiterate that Hong Kong police must respect the observational works of human rights defenders, and the media in covering news. We will be paying close attention and follow this issue.\"

This year\'s pro-democracy protest on the anniversary of Hong Kong\'s return to Chinese rule kept going into the early hours of July 2nd. That\'s when police removed the director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, Law Yuk-kai. Mr. Law was in uniform videotaping police arresting protestors who were blocking traffic. 

Shortly after, police arrested Kiri Choy, an intern at NTD\'s Hong Kong bureau. She was there covering the protest. While Kiri Choy did not have a press pass on her at the time, she explained she was a reporter. She was taken to the police station and held for more 10 hours, even though NTD had promptly faxed through her credentials.

The American Mission Hospital, affiliated with the National Evangelical Church, has operated continuously in Bahrain for more than a century. Bahrain has also been a base for U.S. naval activity in the Persian Gulf since 1947. When Bahrain became independent, the U.S.-Bahrain relationship was formalized with the establishment of diplomatic relations. The U.S. embassy at Manama was opened September 21, 1971, and a resident ambassador was sent in 1974. The Bahraini embassy in Washington, DC, opened in 1977. In October 1991, Emir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa made a state visit to Washington. In 2001, Emir Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa made his first visit to the U.S. after succeeding his father in 1999. He returned to Washington on an official visit in January 2003. King Hamad made an official visit to Washington in November 2004 to meet with President Bush and cabinet-level officials.
Bahrain and the United States signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement in October 1991 granting U.S. forces access to Bahraini facilities and ensuring the right to pre-position material for future crises. Bahrain is the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. The U.S. designated Bahrain a Major Non-NATO Ally in October 2001.
