‘It doesn’t matter whether Al Jazeera has one source or ten sources’ - Worldnews.com

 In an interview with CNN’s Brian Stelter that aired yesterday, Al Jazeera investigative reporter Deborah Davies claimed that her network’s investigation into a possible “link” between Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and human growth hormone has gained further corroboration. “What you didn’t know until now, is that we had a second source. Absolutely impeccably placed, […] ...

Five years after the Syrian civil war began, images of bombings, destruction and suffering continue to dominate the coverage on television screens.Before the war, the ancient city of Aleppo was Syria\'s largest city and the country\'s financial heart.Anti-government fighters partially controlled the city for some time, but have lost much of it after intense Russian airstrikes in support of Syrian government forces.Once a bustling city of two million, Aleppo is now a war zone, mortared and shelled into oblivion - a city under attack and under siege. Many have been killed and many more have fled. But what about those who have stayed? Those who are trapped inside? Away from the battlefront, what has life become for the people of Aleppo?This is what renowned Syrian photographer Ammar Abd Rabbo has tried to capture in his latest exhibition. Rabbo is one of the Arab world\'s most prominent photographers.For the past 20 years, he has witnessed some of the most profound political changes in the Middle East and made intimate portraits of heads of states.From Libya, to Iraq, to Lebanon, his works have been published in the world\'s most widely-circulated publications, earning him numerous awards and accolades.Over the last few years, Ammar Abd Rabbo has travelled to Aleppo several times to bring back images - snapshots of everyday life that not only remind us of the impact of the ongoing Syrian war, but also show the strength and resilience of the people of Aleppo. His photos show that live still goes on in war-torn Aleppo despite the war, destruction and devastation....

Nine months after he came to power, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari received an official welcome from Qatar\'s Emir on Buhari\'s latest trip of many to boost Nigeria\'s standing abroad.The Nigerian president is seeking support for his crackdown on corruption and to encourage much-needed investment in his country\'s ailing economy.Qatar is the current president of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Nigeria is Africa\'s largest oil producer.Low oil prices have a devastating impact on the Nigerian economy, which has long depended on the export of oil. \"We were unable to diversify our economy, hence we are much more disadvantaged by the lower oil prices,\" Buhari says.Buhari tells us he values the institution of OPEC and that \"Nigeria will make the necessary sacrifice to remain in OPEC.\"With a chorus of voices, including from the IMF, calling for the Nigerian government to devalue the naira, Buhari says he will not reconsider his insistence on freezing the currency. Buhari says as Nigeria \"virtually imports everything, from rice to toothpicks\", it cannot afford to devalue its currency.\"If it is against our national interest, why can\'t we go against the IMF advice?\" Buhari asks.Buhari\'s election campaign rode on pledges to root out corruption and quash Boko Haram. Yet, Boko Haram remains active in many areas of Nigeria, seemingly able to strike at will.And many questions are being asked about whether Buhari\'s anti-corruption drive is yielding results and if newer forms of corruption are emerging with a freeze on the naira.President Buhar...

Raising its black flag over the rugged mountainous regions of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has emerged as a new threat to the war-ravaged country as it battles the Taliban for supremacy. 

Employing violence and brutality used by the group in Syria and Iraq, Wilayat Khorasan, (the ancient name ISIL has chosen for the region made up of Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of neighbouring countries), has emerged in seven different areas and vowed to step up operations, where the veteran fighters, the Taliban, once held sway.

Fighting to reconstitute the historical Khorasan into the so-called \'Caliphate\' of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group says it has grand plans for the region, starting with uprooting the Taliban and the government of President Ashraf Ghani.

Causing friction with the regional and overall leadership of the Taliban, armed battles have increased over the past few months with dozens of Taliban fighters killed in the clashes, most notably in the Taliban stronghold of Nangarhar province.

ISIL\'s local chapter has also managed to attract dozens of fighters from the Taliban\'s ranks into its fold, while foreign fighters unable to make it to Syria and Iraq have thronged to the group\'s territory.

In ISIL and the Taliban we look at the group\'s growing popularity, how it made steady inroads into the country and the threat it poses for the future of Afghanistan.

We gain exclusive access to ISIL\'s central leadership, and meet children as young as 5-years-old being trained to fight and dedicate their lives to the \'Caliphate\'.

Shot, then blown to smithereens with military grade explosives, the 2006 killing of Altantuya Shaariibuu was one of Malaysia’s most sensational murder cases. Even though years have passed since the young Mongolian woman’s death, it is one case that has refused to disappear. If anything, the mystery has deepened.
 
101 East investigates those who were involved in the case and asks whether the two men convicted of her murder are “fall guys” for others who ordered the killing of Shaariibuu.

Among the hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Europe a significant number is made up of young men from Afghanistan. Last year, more than 100,000 Afghans fled to Europe and the exodus continues.

But why are so many Afghans leaving their home country?

In Kabul\'s Kote Sangi neighbourhood, painters, carpenters, plasterers, and other manual workers sit outside waiting for someone to come by and hire them, even if only for a few hours. 

This scene is replicated throughout the Afghan capital as thousands of casual workers hope to earn a dollar or more a day, the desperation etched on many faces. But their chances aren\'t good. These men don\'t have the family or the political connections often needed to get a job. And Afghanistan\'s unemployment rate is estimated to be at 40 percent or higher.

Afghanistan\'s economy still depends heavily on international aid and 61 percent of the country\'s operating budget is funded by foreign donors. 

The withdrawal of more than 100,000 NATO troops, and a scaling down of aid has shrunk the economy drastically. Building bases for the troops, staffing them, moving food and water to them, injected billions of dollars into the economy and employed tens of thousands of Afghans for years. 

In response to the economic downturn, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has launched the National Employment Programme in November 2015 to give thousands of Afghans job opportunities.

But will he succeed? How do do young Afghans feel about their country\'s economic future?

al Jazeera (Arabic: الجزيرة‎ al-ǧazīrah IPA: [æl dʒæˈziːrɐ], literally "The Island", abbreviating "The [Arabian] Peninsula") (also Aljazeera or JSC [Jazeera Satellite Channel]) is an independent broadcaster owned by the state of Qatar through the Qatar Media Corporation and headquartered in Doha, Qatar. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the Internet and specialty TV channels in multiple languages. Al Jazeera is accessible in several world regions.
The original Al Jazeera channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, for example on call-in shows, created controversies in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The station gained worldwide attention following the September 11, 2001 attacks, when it was the only channel to cover the war in Afghanistan live from its office there.
In the 2000s, the network was praised by the Index on Censorship for circumventing censorship and contributing to the free exchange of information in the Arab world, and by the Webby Awards, who nominated it as one of the five best news web sites, along with BBC News, National Geographic and The Smoking Gun. It was also voted by brandchannel.com readers as the fifth most influential global brand behind Apple, Google, Ikea and Starbucks. In 2011 Salon.com noted Al Jazeera's coverage of the 2011 Egyptian protests as superior to that of the American news media, while U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also opined that that network's news coverage was more informative, and less opinion-driven than American journalism.
