China warns of continuing terrorist threat in Xinjiang - Herald-Whig -
BEIJING (AP) Â— China is warning that terrorism still poses a threat in its restive northwestern region of Xinjiang despite a massive security presence and the passage of tough new anti-terrorism legislation.
Public Security Ministry anti-terrorism specialist Liu Yuejin said the law that took effect Jan. 1 had greatly boosted information sharing both domestically and internationally. He spoke in an online conversation posted Saturday.
Still, Liu said terrorist acts were continuing in some parts of Xinjiang, where resentment against Chinese rule lingers among the native Turkic Muslim Uighur (WEE-gur) population, which is ethnically, religiously and linguistically distinct from China's Han majority.
China says it faces a threat from overseas groups, although many observers question that assertion and say Beijing's definition of terrorism includes nonviolent acts of defiance and innocent support for Uighur culture.
