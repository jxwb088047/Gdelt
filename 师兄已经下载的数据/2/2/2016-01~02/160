I strongly believe women have the right to dress in which ever way they want and also believe that guys play a major role, they should not talk in disgusting ways and should lower their gaze. This video was in no way a survey or an accurate representation and should not be considered as such. This video was done as an experiment and these were the results with no tampering or editing trickery. Footage that was left out due to time does not change the outcome represented in this video. This video was made to respect women of any kind who dress in anyway. Please feel free to share.

I LOVE YOU ALL!

Disclaimer: This is a social experiment and no one was hurt. Physical abuse is an issue for many and what we are trying to see here is how people would react, if someone of a different culture and in their country were to abuse someone in front of their eyes. It was revealed to these people that this was for a video and an experiment. You can see that footage and those reactions on my 2nd channel AreWeKuKuNow. Thank you

REACTION VIDEO: https://youtu.be/-9sa9ZiR32w
We just arrived back home from Spring Break in Dubai, and we loved every minute of it! We took over 3 hours of footage, and whittled it down to this 22 minute vlog, and hope that you can feel what is was like to have been on vacation with us!

About six months ago, we noticed that on the BeautyCon website, they were asking fans to vote on the next location for their beauty event. Dubai was the top vote getter by a long ways, but BeautyCon decided to go with #2 instead and hold a BeautyCon in Dallas TX, along with NY and LA. We felt sad for all of the fans in Dubai who wanted so desperately for YouTubers to visit their country, enough to get the most votes in the poll. 

We talked about this as a family, and decided that we are able to do what we love because of each one of you. We decided to start saving some money aside and using it to go out to you. Our first destination??? Yes, you guessed it... Dubai!

A few highlights of our trip were the Burj al Arab, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Al Ain, Desert Jeep Safari, The Grand Mosque, etc! Most importantly, we had a chance to meet so many of you during our whole week there! We held a meet-up in Zabeel Park, expecting about 200-250 fans would come. We were shocked that nearly 1,500 of you showed up, and we extended the meet-up form 2 hrs to 4 hours just so that we could meet as many of you that we could! That was one of the most rewarding experiences of our YouTube lives so far! We thank and love you all, for those who came and those who were unable to come! We promise to visit you again!

Hope you enjoy this vlog, and feel more a part of our family!

While trying to shoot a Funny Dating experiment to see if I can pick up dates wearing a leopard print T-shirt we instead ran into something we did not expect. We ran into a woman who made her hatred towards Muslims known. The woman had no shame with the very hurtful and clearly misguided things she said once she found out I was a Muslim.

This Social Experiment is proof that hate against Muslims is not welcome in Australia. Almost every person interfered to stop the hate filled attacks. Truly inspirational.

NOTE: This video is copyright. No one is allowed to re-upload it, nor use it nor broadcast it anywhere without the content creator's permission.

There is no doubt Islamophobia occurs in Australia (as we've already seen countless times), whether promoted by the media, politicians or the rare bigoted inidividual - however after shooting this experiment we are certain that the Australian public do not welcome hate against Muslims and it must be stopped.
