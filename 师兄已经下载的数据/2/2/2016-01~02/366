Beijing, Feb 3 (EFE).- China released Wednesday the results of a judicial investigation which says Chinese Uighurs from the northwestern Xinjiang region have been trained as "terrorists" in Afghanistan, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
The government said courts have commuted the sentences of 11 Chinese nationals, sentenced for secessionism and participating in terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, and revealed details of the judicial investigations, including alleged training bases for the Uighurs in Afghanistan, established by one of the convicts, Memet Tohti Memet Rozi.
Rozi, Xinhua reported, had close contact with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and Taliban terrorist groups.
Beijing says there are extremist groups in Xinjiang, many headed by Uighurs, who demand independence for the territory under the name of East Turkestan and have links with foreign organizations, especially those from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
However, Uighur groups in exile complain this is Beijing's excuse to repress their religion and culture, and say that the recent increase in ethnic clashes is due to the persistent violation of their human rights.
Meanwhile, the sentences of seven of those convicted to life imprisonment have been commuted to between 19.5-20 years in prison while the sentences of the other four were reduced by six months.
However, for Uighurs in exile the announcement is just another ploy by the regime to silence critics who accuse it of lack of transparency.
