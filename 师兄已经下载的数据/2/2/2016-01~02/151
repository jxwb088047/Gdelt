Paris Attacks: US President Barack Obama holds press conference on fight against IS group

France Air Forces Drops 20 Bombs on ISIS in Raqqa, Syria
Paris attacks: false information and rumors spread throughout social media
(CNN)French fighter jets bombed a series of ISIS sites in Raqqa, Syria, on Sunday in what officials described as a major bombardment.

The airstrikes came two days after a series of terrorist attacks in Paris. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which France\'s President described as \"an act of war.\"

ISIS claims Raqqa as the capital of its so-called caliphate. The targets in Sunday\'s airstrikes included a command center, a recruitment center, an ammunition storage base and a training camp for the terror group, said Mickael Soria, press adviser for France\'s defense minister.

Twelve aircraft, including 10 fighter jets, were involved in the airstrikes, Soria said. Twenty bombs were dropped, he said, and all of the targets were destroyed.
A pro-ISIS news agency claimed the sites had been abandoned before they were hit.

President Obama gave a rare Oval Office speech over the weekend. He talked about the threat of ISIL and what we should do. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"President Barack Obama on Sunday laid out the most sweeping defense yet of his strategy to defeat Islamic State, but he offered no U.S. policy shift to confront what he called a \"new phase\" in the terrorist threat after a mass shooting in California.

In a rare Oval Office address, Obama sought to calm a U.S. public increasingly jittery about the fight against Islamist militancy that once appeared to be waged overseas. His remarks failed to quiet Republican critics who have long accused him of underestimating the militants\' strength and staying power.

Speaking in a measured tone, Obama used his 14-minute nationally televised appearance to draw a careful line about what he would and would not do. He pledged, for example, to \"hunt down terrorist plotters\" anywhere they are. But he insisted: \"We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria.\"

Obama spoke just four days after U.S.-born Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, opened fire on a holiday party for civil servants in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. The pair were killed hours later in a shootout with police.

Obama condemned the attack as \"an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people.\" But he also said San Bernardino showed that \"the terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase\" as Islamic State used ...
