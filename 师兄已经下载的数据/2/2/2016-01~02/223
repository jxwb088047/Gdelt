Poppy Harlow was filling in for another host on CNN, when she began to slur her words and then faint. Everyone is ok, so we took the opportunity to look back at some classic on-air pass outs. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"While filling in for Carol Costello on CNN Newsroom, something rather odd happened to Poppy Harlowas she was presenting a report on American efforts against ISIS terror.

After a report from Becky Anderson, Harlow presented viewers with a CNN/ORC poll reflecting the disapproval Americans have shown forPresident Obama‘s efforts to deal with radical Islamists. As she explained the graphic, Harlow’s speech began to slur before she stopped altogether, and CNN soon cut away to a commercial.”*

hold-downs or anchor bolts

Residential structural systems are often composed of footings and framing (floor framing, wall framing, and ceiling framing). The connection between the framing and footings is secured by anchor bolts or hold-downs. Since historically, homes without anchor bolts slid off their foundations under earthquake load (in Southern California's Northridge Earthquake, for example), anchor bolts are a regular part of all new home building codes and many older homes have been retrofitted with either anchor bolts or hold-down straps. Anchor bolts are embedded in the footings either at footing creation or epoxied into the existing footings. Hold-downs are bolted to the framing and bolted to existing footings. Hold-downs or anchor bolts are used to securely fasten residential framing to footings.

hold-downs or anchor bolts
A older codes did not required anchor bolts but new codes do
B fasten house framing securely to footings
C stainless steel plates to connect parts of structural system

Arnub Goswami has a history of being slapped by Pakistani Analysts but he doesn't get a lesson and wants to be slapped more times.
