In a setback for US President Barack Obama’s gun control measures, the University of Texas in Austin has allowed for the students to carry guns into classrooms.

The University president, angered by the decision, described it as the greatest challenge of his presidency to date. Gregory Fenves, however, noted that he has an obligation to uphold the law. He further expressed solidarity with many faculty members, staffers, students, and their families who called for a ban on guns from the campus. Last August, lawmakers in the politically Conservative state passed a bill, prohibiting gun bans on public college campuses. Last year, Obama introduced measures to expand background checks for gun purchases in a bid to fight rampant gun violence in the US. His action has been met with criticism from legislators and powerful gun advocacy groups.

Concealed handguns will be allowed in University of Texas classrooms states new rules approved Wednesday by the school\'s president, whose hand was forced by a new state law.
University President Greg Fenves opposes allowing guns on the roughly 50,000-student campus. Texas\' universities had been gun-free zones under the state\'s previous concealed handgun laws, but the Republican-dominated Legislature voted last year to force public universities to allow license holders to bring their guns to campus starting Aug. 1.
\"I do not believe handguns belong on a university campus, so this decision has been the greatest challenge of my presidency to date,\" Fenves said in announcing his decision to adopt rules recommended by a campus study group in December.
But gun-rights activists insist the right to have weapons on campus falls under the Second Amendment and they call it a critical self-defense measure.
Guns will generally be banned from dorm rooms, but they will be allowed in residence hall common areas such as dining rooms and study areas.
Family members who are licensed to carry can keep their weapons when visiting students. University staff members who are licensed to carry may also hold onto their weapons if they must enter a dorm.
The rules now go to the University of Texas System Regents for review. If no changes are made within 90 days, the rules will be final.

A new law that looks certain to pass through the Texas legislature would mean that its 38 public colleges, which are attended by half a million students, must permit concealed handguns on site.

It would become only the second state, after Utah, to enforce such a rule.

More than 20 states have rejected similar proposals introduced since the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007.

At present, colleges in Texas -- along with churches and businesses -- are free to ban firearms from their premises. Guns are prohibited from university buildings, dormitories and surrounding grounds.

The plan is likely to astonish most who recall the mass shootings at Virginia Tech, where a student killed 32 people, and in Northern Illinois the following year, where five people were murdered.

It is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. Founded in 1883, its campus is approximately 0.25 miles (400 m) from the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The institution has the fifth-largest single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2010 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997 to 2003), with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff. It currently holds the largest enrollment of any college in Texas.
The University of Texas at Austin was named one of the original eight Public Ivy institutions and was inducted into the American Association of Universities in 1929. The university is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $640 million for the 2009–2010 school year. The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum and the Blanton Museum of Art, and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and the McDonald Observatory. Among university faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, the Wolf Prize, and the National Medal of Science, as well as many other awards.
