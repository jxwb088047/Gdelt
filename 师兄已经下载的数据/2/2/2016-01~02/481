Ignore Grover Norquist: Medi-Cal fix is a good deal - Worldnews.com

After a federal ruling last year threatened to cut aid for Medi-Cal by more than $1 billion, the Brown administration and lawmakers proposed a set of tax increases and reductions that would avert the cut without forcing higher costs onto

If you have Medi-Cal, chances are you get your health care for free — until you die, that is. Since 1993, Medi-Cal — California’s version of the federal Medicaid program — has sought repayment of many medical costs, primarily those incurred after age 55. It’s called the Estate Recovery Program, and under Obamacare, it just got bigger and its reach broader. How broad? Well, your...
The 2010 federal healthcare reform law required virtually all adult Americans to carry insurance, starting this year. And to help make policies affordable, it offered subsidies to lower-income households while expanding the Medicaid insurance program to more of the poorest residents.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown proposed a $122.6 billion budget plan for California on Thursday that attempts to balance his fiscally restrained approach to spending with increasing demands for California to invest in social service and health care programs that suffered cuts during the recession. The plan calls for significant increases in funding for education,...

When the California Endowment, a private foundation that promotes access to affordable healthcare, offered the state government $6 million to help prevent poor Californians from dropping out of the Medi-Cal health insurance program, you might have expected officials to smile and say "Thank you."

\"I think it speaks to the health of American society that people don\'t buy into envy and class antagonisms the way that the Left thinks they do,\" says Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and author of End the IRS Before It Ends Us: How to Restore a Low Tax, High Growth, Wealthy America.

Ending the income tax is part of Norquist\'s wide-ranging push to reign in spending and reform government entitlements. As he explains to Reason\'s Nick Gillespie, the revolution is beginning in the most unlikeliest of states: Kansas.

\"Kansas is the future. Kansas is the model,\" Norquist says. \"It became a Reagan-Republican House, Senate and governorship only with Governor Brownback\'s governorship. He...passed a law that fazes out the income tax over time. As revenue comes in from economic growth–more than 2%–you ratchet down the income tax.\"

As Americans realize states don\'t need an income tax to fit their budgets, Norquist argues, people will start to question why the federal government needs one too. \"For most of our country\'s history we didn\'t have an income tax,\" Norquist explains. \"In our 50 states, nine don\'t have income taxes. I think in the next 15 years it will be 25 that don\'t have income taxes.\"

For Norquist stopping ever-growing government and taxation is the only way to bring economic competitiveness back, but it\'s average Americans that will make that change. \"For those of us who think small government and low taxes is a better idea, guess what? Most people are with us. People are moving from high-tax states to low-tax states.\"

\"Historically, opposition to immigration in the United States has been racially and religiously motivated in the ugliest, nastiest way possible,\" says Grover Norquist, President and Founder of Americans for Tax Reform.

Reason Magazine\'s Matt Welch caught up with Norquist at this year\'s Freedom Fest to discuss effective immigration reform.

\"[The] people who think that building higher walls or deeper walls or moats and alligators and stuff,\" Norquist says, \"they\'re chasing problems that can be fixed more easily by expanding liberty rather than contracting it.\"

Held each July in Las Vegas, Freedom Fest is attended by around 2,000 limited-government enthusiasts and libertarians a year. ReasonTV spoke with over two dozen speakers and attendees and will be releasing interviews over the coming weeks.

About 12 minutes.

Grover Glenn Norquist (born October 19, 1956) is a conservative libertarian Republican who is founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that opposes all tax increases. He is the primary promoter of the \"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\", a pledge by lawmakers to oppose increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses, as well as net reductions or eliminations of deductions and credits without a matching reduced tax rate. Prior to the November 2012 election, the pledge was signed by 95% of all Republican Members of Congress and all but one of the candidates running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

Norquist is best known for founding Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) in 1985, which he says was done at the request of then-President Ronald Reagan.[16] Referring to Norquist\'s activities as head of ATR, Steve Kroft, in a 60 Minutes episode that aired on November 20, 2011, claimed that \"Norquist has been responsible, more than anyone else, for rewriting the dogma of the Republican Party.\"[17]
The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce government revenues as a percentage of the GDP.[18][19] ATR states that it \"opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle.\"[20] Americans for Tax Reform has supported Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) legislation[21] and transparency initiatives,[22] while opposing cap-and-trade legislation[23] and efforts to regulate health care.[24]

\"Agent of Influence – Grover Norquist and the Assault on the Right\" is the booklet from the Center for Security on Grover Norquist check it out at http://www.GlennBecksBookList.com or http://www.bit.ly/GroverNorquistNRABook

Agent of Influence – Grover Norquist and the Assault on the Right, now in its fourth edition, reproduces the national security practitioners’ letter to Ms. Mitchell and the accompanying Statement of Facts that directly challenged and disproved her representations to the ACU Board. Specifically, as the Statement documents, both Grover Norquist and Suhail Khan have had relationships with a bevy of individuals with strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood – including jailed al-Qaeda financier and Brotherhood kingpin Abdurahman Alamoudi and a one-time leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Sami al-Arian. This edition of the dossier entitled, Agent of Influence: Grover Norquist and the Assault on the Right – Targeting the NRA, also features highly illuminating correspondence in the Spring of 2014 between Ms. Mitchell and General Mukasey and in the course of Norquist’s NRA Board reelection bid in the winter of 2015. Two of the latter were authored Mr. Norquist, and responded to by Mr. Gaffney.

From Frank Gaffney’s Foreword to the Fourth Edition of Agent of Influence:

The Statement of Facts draws upon a wealth of information from credible government, media and other sources available to anyone interested in knowing the truth about the Norquist-Khan Islamist influence operation and the role it has played in enabling and advancing the Brotherhood’s designs.

Grover Glenn Norquist (born October 19, 1956) is an American lobbyist, conservative activist, and founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is best known as the promoter of the "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", which was signed by 95% of all Republican Congressmen and all but one of the 2012 Republican presidential candidates, to oppose increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses, as well as net reductions or eliminations of deductions and credits without a matching reduced tax rate.
Norquist grew up in Weston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Carol (née Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist, a vice president of Polaroid Corporation. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age and in his early teenage years he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts. He graduated from Weston High School and enrolled at Harvard University in 1974, where he obtained both a B.A. and an M.B.A.. While in college, Norquist was an editor at the Harvard Crimson and helped to publish the libertarian-leaning Harvard Chronicle. Norquist has said: "When I became 21, I decided that nobody learned anything about politics after the age of 21." He attended the Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia, an organization that teaches conservative Americans how to influence public policy through activism and leadership.
