In an exclusive interview with NPR’s Nina Totenberg, the president explained his decision to nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and defended his choice, calling Garland “one of the best judges not just in the country, but of his generation.” Obama also blasted the Senate for obstructing the confirmation process, saying if it truly refuses to consider Garland, it would be setting a new precedent and “at that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics.”

Recently, President Obama and his motorcade of citywide gridlock rolled into Austin, Texas to push more Big Brother style Federal control of the technology sector at the 2016 SXSW festival. But it was a remark he made at a Democratic National Committee reception that drew ire to the ears of anyone paying attention to the growing threat building up on the Texas border. Obama claimed “ Illegal immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years.” This statement was nothing less than a bait and switch aimed at the supposed stupidity of the American people. And a dangerous statement to boot.

How so you ask? Obama was referring to the comparison of border patrol apprehension numbers in the 1970’s to the present numbers. The DHS defines apprehension data as “...data collected by DHS represent events, not individuals.\"

Since 1970, apprehension numbers rose from 231,116 in 1970 to 888,729 by 1979. Apprehensions increased averaging in the millions throughout the 80’s, 90’s and the beginning of the new millennium. Under George W. Bush Apprehension numbers began to decline in 2007 after Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the U.S. under a temporary guest worker program.

As the baton was handed to yet another New World Order puppet. Obama opened the floodgates for a mass exodus with an unconstitutional Executive Order protecting 5 million illegals. Meanwhile in February of 2016, DHS quietly created a new policy making it mandatory for Border Patrol Agents to release illegals- without a notice to appear before a judge.

The numbers don’t lie. ...

Barack Hussein Obama II (i/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to hold the office. In January 2005, Obama was sworn in as a U.S. Senator in the state of Illinois. He would hold this office until November 2008, when he resigned following his victory in the 2008 presidential election.
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004.
Following an unsuccessful bid against the Democratic incumbent for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2000, Obama ran for the United States Senate in 2004. Several events brought him to national attention during the campaign, including his victory in the March 2004 Illinois Democratic primary for the Senate election and his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He won election to the U.S. Senate in Illinois in November 2004. His presidential campaign began in February 2007, and after a close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination. In the 2008 presidential election, he defeated Republican nominee John McCain, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. In April 2011, he announced that he would be running for re-election in 2012.
