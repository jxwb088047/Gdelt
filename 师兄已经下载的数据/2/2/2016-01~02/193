Thirty-four American military officers in charge of the nation\'s nuclear missile programs have been accused of cheating on their exams. This calls into question the safety of the U.S. nuclear systems. Dozens of the people safeguarding the world\'s most dangerous weapons had their security clearances revoked in the latest scandal to affect the American military. 

Officers taking the exam were shown sharing answers to a monthly exam by text message. The incident occurred at Malstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Air Force stated that some of the 34 officers who were caught in the incident actively cheated, while others knew of the practice, and did nothing to stop it. 

Air Force Chief-of-Staff Mark Welsh said, \"We don\'t yet know how or if each of those officers used that material, but we do know that none of them reported the incident to their leadership.\"

Due to the widespread cheating which has been revealed, the Air Force is re-testing every officer responsible for the operation of nuclear weapons. 

In October, Air Force Major General Michael Carey was fired for becoming drunk on carousing with women during an official trip to Moscow. Revelations of widespread cheating on the exam grew out of an investigation into drug use among the people charged with safeguarding the nation\'s nuclear deterrent. 

President Obama has been dismissing military leaders at a rate rarely seen in American history. This series of scandals to rock the armed forces begs the question of whether the appointments are the reason or the cause behind such incidents.

FIRST LOOK Inside the U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS Bases & The TROOPS on Standby Waiting To LAUNCH The NUKE

World Bank whistleblower Karen Hudes speaks to The ForeRunner Chronicles for a interview that exposes news From US Military officers fired by Barack Obama to a nuclear false flag attack upon US soil.

Exclusive investigation: The 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may still be alive. This stunning realization is now supported by considerable emerging evidence detailed in this article. At the same time, the \"vanished\" Boeing 777 may also be in a hanger in Iran right now, being retrofitted with nuclear weapons and turned into a suicide bomb to be deployed over a major city in the Middle East. This possibility is discussed in detail, below, with supporting evidence.

The idea that Flight 370 passengers and crew may still be alive is not a bizarre theory. Even Reuters is now reporting that U.S. authorities have stated, \"...it\'s also possible the plane may have landed somewhere.\"

NUKE STASH!: US focuses on Syrian CHEMICAL & NUCLEAR weapon stockpiles [Post-Assad plans]

Painting a picture of a post-Assad Syria, Washington has voiced concern over how it can secure the country\'s chemical weapons stockpiles in case the regime falls while under attack. Some experts warn that this is only a new pretext for meddling.

Speaking to reporters, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said he was concerned about how the US and its allies would be able to secure the chemical and biological weapons stored in various locations across Syria and make sure they do not end up in the wrong hands.

\"I think the greater concern right now is, what steps does the international community take to make sure that when Assad comes down, that there is a process and procedure to make sure we get our hands on securing those sites,\" Panetta told a news conference. \"That, I think, is the greater challenge right now.\"

Stressing that the US has no plans of putting ground troops in Syria, the Pentagon chief did however add that the US could provide forces if the Assad government agrees to a peaceful transition. \"You always have to keep the possibility that, if there is a peaceful transition and international organizations get involved, that they might ask for assistance in that situation.\"

At the same press conference, General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that if the Assad government decides to use its chemical weapons, the US military would be unable to stop it. He therefore stressed that the US must rely on deterrence and continue warning Syria that us...

Pakistan says it will not compromise on its stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Pakistani officials say Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will tell US President Barack Obama that Islamabad won’t accept limits on the use of small tactical nukes. The two leaders are set to meet at the White House later on Thursday. Pakistan insists that tactical weapons would deter a surprise attack by its nuclear rival India and that America’s demand is unreasonable. But the US is concerned that the smaller size of the bombs may make them more tempting to use in a conventional war. Washington is preparing to sell eight F-16 fighter jets to Islamabad as part of efforts to bolster bilateral ties. However, the offer seems not to be attractive enough to dissuade Pakistan.

The nuclear arms race was a competition for supremacy in nuclear warfare between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies during the Cold War. During this period, in addition to the American and Soviet nuclear stockpiles, other countries developed nuclear weapons, though none engaged in warhead production on nearly the same scale as the two superpowers.

Korean/Nat

The highest ranking military defector from North Korea has warned that North Korea is stockpiling nuclear and chemical weapons.

Speaking in Washington D-C, Choi Joo Hwal, who defected from North Korea in two years ago, also said western food aid is going to the military instead of the starving.

Choi Joo Hwal, who was a colonel in the Korean People\'s Army when he defected to rival South Korea in October 1995, warned the U-S government that North Korea was ready for war.

SOUNDBITE: (Korean)

North Koreans believe it is important to prepare for the war with the United States with nuclear weapons and chemical weapons, so they have been trying very hard to produce these weapons. 
SUPER CAPTION: North Korea defector Choi Joo Hwal

Choi also said Kim Jong Il has a firm grip on power and is continuing to put scarce resources into North Korea\'s large military. He also claims the current food aid from the western world is being funnelled away from the starving population. 

SOUNDBITE: (Korean)

The current food aid is not used to save people from starvation, but it goes first of all to the military food supply stockpiling and then afterwards the rest will go to the top party leaders and military leaders and then to the top government officials and privileged classes.
SUPER CAPTION: North Korea defector Choi Joo Hwal

Choi, who now works for the South Korean government\'s Research Institute for North Korean Affairs, said the United States should be wary about continuing aid.
