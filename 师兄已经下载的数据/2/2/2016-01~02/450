An eighth-grader in Texas received a two day suspension for saving the life of one of his classmates. After a student fell to the floor in an asthma attack, the teacher sent an email to the school nurse and waited. Anthony Ruelas then took matters into his own hands. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“An eighth-grader in a Killeen, Texas school was suspended for two days for helping a classmate who collapsed while suffering an asthma attack, WXIA-TV reported.
“I broke rules but, she needed help,” said the student, Anthony Ruelas.
Ruelas’ mother, Mandy Cortes, produced a note from Ruelas’ fifth-period teacher at Gateway Middle School describing the incident. According to the instructor, the unidentified girl was in class on Tuesday when she started complaining about not being able to breath, telling the teacher she was having an attack.
“As I waited for a response from the nurse the student fell out of her chair to the floor,” the teacher explained. “Anthony proceeded to go over and pick her up, saying ‘F*ck that we ain’t got time to wait for no email from the nurse.’”*
