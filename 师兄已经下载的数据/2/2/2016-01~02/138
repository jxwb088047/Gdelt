Why Hillary Could Be a Lot More Vulnerable to Trump Than Bernie - Worldnews.com

Hillary will have enormous difficulty defending herself on three key issues: trade, war and Wall Street.
Cousin Jeff worries that a vote for Bernie is a vote for a Republican sweep in the fall. Iris, a

Hillary is trapped until she shifts positions. Hillary lost Michigan because she truly believes Wall Street, trade and runaway inequality are separate, single issues. She...
No one can deny that economic inequality is accelerating. In 1980 the average top 100 CEOs earned $45 for every dollar earned by an average worker. Today, the gap is an astounding $844 to 1. But there is significant controversy about the impact of runaway inequality on American society and what should be done about it. Economic Inequality and Equal Opportunity One narrative...
Billed as a major populist economic address, Hillary Clinton put forth her jobs program in Michigan. Wall Street is smiling. Team Hillary is crying. Her program fits perfectly within the neoliberal framework as she focuses on how to use public funds and policies to promote private sector gain. There are tax incentives to urge large and small corporations to create more jobs in...

Like most economists, I am strongly inclined toward free trade. I cringe to see the way it is under attack from both parties during this primary season. The two populist candidates are the worst offenders. Bernie Sanders, whom I support on many other issues, goes off the rails when it comes to trade. Donald Trump, whose policy views are sometimes too vague to pin down, has made...
Her mantra is clear: if you do right to the American people, we'll do right by you. Billed as a major populist economic address, Hillary Clinton recently put forth her jobs program in Michigan. Wall Street is smiling. Her program fits perfectly within the neoliberal framework as she focuses on how to use public funds and policies to promote private sector gain. There are tax...
"Free trade": The elites are selling it but the public is longer buying it. Look at the support for Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, especially in light of Sanders' surprise 20-point comeback in this week's Michigan primary. With primaries coming soon in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, will Sanders' trade appeal resonate again? Voters See Free...
A recent poll in Utah shows us beating Donald Trump by 11 points. And if we\'re ahead in Utah by 11 points, there aren\'t gonna be many states in this country that we can\'t win.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer.

President Obama and Bernie Sanders disagree on many things. One of them is Obama’s latest supreme court pick Merrick Garland. Bernie explained what he would like to do if elected President. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, and Maz Jobrani (Jimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Vermont Sen. and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said he fully supports President Obama\'s nominee for the Supreme Court, 63-year-old Judge Merrick Garland. But should Sanders become president-elect in November, he would ask Obama to withdraw his nomination, he said Thursday night in an interview with MSNBC\'s Rachel Maddow. The self-described Democratic socialist would want a justice who\'s more progressive than Garland...

\"I have said over and over again that I do have a litmus test for a Supreme Court justice,\" Sanders said to Maddow. \"The justice must be loud and clear in telling us that he or she will vote to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. I am very worried about the future of American democracy and about the ability of billionaires to buy elections. That is my litmus test and that’s what I would insist on.””*

Last night Bernie Sanders had a field day. He mopped the floor with Hillary Clinton. He received a standing ovation. You wouldn’t know it by looking at the headlines of corporate media. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Hillary Clinton may have been facing Bernie Sanders at Wednesday’s debate, but in reality she was shadowboxing Donald Trump.

The Republican frontrunner, who was the only GOP candidate who had supporters rallying in front of the Democratic debate, was the 800-pound gorilla in the room. He was named outright more than a dozen times, and referenced in the answers that didn’t refer to him directly.

In responding to questions about billionaire businessman, Clinton gave hints of what her general election strategy might look like. She mocked Trump’s “beautiful tall wall” and derided his divisiveness. She drew clear differences in their trade and climate strategies. And Clinton portrayed herself as earnest and wonky and positive, running “an inclusive campaign,” versus the real estate mogul she said profits from promoting divisiveness.

The debate, the last one scheduled for now on the Democratic side, comes as Clinton and Trump seek to cement their leads and secure their parties’ nominations.”*
