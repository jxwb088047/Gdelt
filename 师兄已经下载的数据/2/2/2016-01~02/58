Rubio Mob Attacks Protesters Dressed As Robots - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiFebruary 9, 2016Leave a Comment
Marco Rubio has been accused of being a robot, now protesters dressed up as robots are showing up at Rubio’s rallies. In a recent rally Rubio supporters had enough and attacked a protester dressed up as Rubiobot. Cenk Uygur host of The Young Turks breaks down the attack. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Two liberal activists accused Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s staff of physically “manhandling” them outside of a Rubio event in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Their only crime, they said, was that they were dressed like robots and following Rubio around the state.
The activists — both with the liberal super-PAC American Bridge — said on Twitter that Rubio staff “pushed and shoved” them to the ground outside of Rubio’s Manchester event. Dressed in crudely-made cardboard robot costumes bearing the words “Marco Roboto,” American Bridge vice president Eddie Vale and communications director Kevin McAllister appeared to be trolling Rubio supporters before the incident occurred, though it’s unclear what exactly led to physical escalation. Another person dressed as a robot, affiliated with another liberal advocacy group called Americans United For Change, was also shoved, Vale said.”
