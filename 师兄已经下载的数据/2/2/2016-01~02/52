China executes 3 knife attackers, female attacker gets life in prison
China executes 3 knife attackers – China executed this Tuesday March 24th three men who were sentenced to death for the attack with knives that killed thirty-one people on March 1st 2014 at the Kunming Railway Station, in the provincial capital of Yunnan. The attack, which had also injured more than one hundred and forty people, was described as the “Chinese September 11” by the official media.
The three men were convicted of leading a terrorist group and committing murders, announced the Supreme People’s Court in a statement. One of the attackers, a woman by the name of Patigul Tohti, who was pregnant when arrested, was sentenced to life imprisonment, according to Xinhua news agency.
The names of the prisoners executed are Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad. They are aallegedly from the Uighur minority group.
The Uighurs, Turkic Muslims, live mainly in Xinjiang, a vast western autonomous region of more than 1500 kilometers from Kunming.
“China has recourse to the death penalty for political purposes, without addressing the root of the problem”, denounced Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, an organization for the defense of exiled Uighurs. “The accused had no right to a trial worthy of the name,” he added.
Many Uighurs say they are discriminated against and excluded from the benefits of development in the region, which intensifies the influx of Hans – strong majority ethnic group in China – from the rest of the country.
Experts and human rights groups believe that the repressive policy adopted by Beijing against the culture and religion of the Uighurs is fueling the tensions in Xinjiang.
