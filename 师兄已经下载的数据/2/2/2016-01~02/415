Indonesian authorities are working with their counterparts in China to stem the flow of ethnic ­Uygur militants who are seeking to join ­Islamist jihadists in the world’s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia’s counterterrorism chief said.
Saud Usman Nasution’s comments come amid mounting concern in Indonesia about possible attacks by sympathisers of Islamic State (IS) and follows the arrest of 13 men across the island of Java, including a Muslim Uygur with a suicide-bomb vest.
The appearance among Indonesian militant networks of Uygurs, who come from the Xinjiang region in far-western China, is likely to add to Beijing’s concerns that exiles will return to their homeland as experienced and trained jihadists.
China says Islamist militants and separatists operate in energy-rich Xinjiang on the borders of central Asia, where violence has killed hundreds in recent years.
Rights groups say much of the unrest can be traced back to frustration at controls over the Uygurs’ culture and religion, and that most of those who leave are only fleeing repression not seeking to wage jihad. China denies ­repressing rights.
Nasution, who heads the National Counter-Terrorism Agency, said several Uygurs had responded to a call last year by Santoso, Indonesia’s most high-profile backer of IS, to join his band of fighters. IS and human trafficking networks helped them travel via Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia to Santoso’s hideout in an equatorial jungle of eastern Indonesia.
However, the would-be suicide bomber arrested on December 23 was hiding in a house just outside the capital, Jakarta.
“We are cooperating with China and investigating evidence such as ATM cards and cellphones,” Nasution said, adding that an Indonesian team went to China to interview members of the man’s family.
There was no immediate comment from China’s foreign ministry on whether Beijing is collaborating with Indonesia.
“As far as China is concerned, these people are running off, some of them taking part in jihad and planning to strike back,” said Pan Zhiping, a terrorism expert at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences. “Of course we must stop them. I believe, in terms of jointly guarding against extremism, it is necessary that we cooperate.”
Bilveer Singh of the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore said the direct ­involvement of Chinese Uygurs in Southeast Asian militancy added “an external dimension to the existing home-grown terrorist threat”.
“It could also complicate ties with a rising China, which may want to play a bigger counterterrorism role in the region,” Singh wrote in a Eurasia Review article.
Indonesia’s security forces have given Santoso, who styles himself as the commander of the IS army in Indonesia, until January 9 to surrender along with his force of about 40 men on the far-flung island of Sulawesi. However, security analysts believe a larger threat is emerging across the populous island of Java as networks of support for IS grow.
Indonesia has been largely successful in disrupting domestic militant cells since the bombing of two nightclubs on the resort island of Bali in 2002, and sporadic attacks have been mainly targeted at the police.
The government is now worried that the influence of IS could bring a return of jihadi violence and strikes against foreigners and soft targets.
Officials believe there are more than 1,000 Islamic State supporters in Indonesia, and say that between 100 and 300 have returned from Syria, though this includes women and children.
