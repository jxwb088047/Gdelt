Guantanamo Bay prisoner refuses resettlement in Balkans | TribLIVE
A Guantanamo Bay prisoner who protested his indefinite confinement with a lengthy hunger strike has taken the unusual step of turning down a chance to finally leave the U.S. base in Cuba, rejecting an offer to be resettled in an unfamiliar country.
Muhammad Bawazir, a 35-year-old from Yemen, refused to board a plane as two other prisoners were being flown out for resettlement in the Balkans, his lawyer, John Chandler, said Thursday. Since returning to his homeland was not an option, he insisted on being sent to a country where he has family.
Chandler said he spent months trying to persuade Bawazir to accept the resettlement in another country he declined to name. But the prisoner, who was 21 when captured in Afghanistan, apparently decided at the last minute he could not do it.
“It's a country I'd go to in a heartbeat,” the Atlanta-based attorney said. “I can't help you with the logic of his position. It's just a very emotional reaction from a man who has been locked up for 14 years.”
Several prisoners over the years have resisted returning to their country, fearing treatment at the hands of their government. Some of the ethnic Uighurs held for years at the base once spurned a resettlement offer in the Pacific island nation of Palau because it seemed too close to China, the country they said they fled because of intense persecution.
Still, the decision by Bawazir is unusual. Yemenis at Guantanamo, who cannot be sent to their homeland because of a civil war, have been described by officials and lawyers as eager for any way out of the prison.
“The rest of the guys there, if I had offered them the opportunity to go, they would have said, ‘Show me the plane,' ” said Chandler, who has three clients at Guantanamo after two others went to the United Arab Emirates for resettlement.
The two prisoner releases announced Thursday brought to 16 the total to leave in January as President Obama works to whittle the number of low-level detainees and seeks to close the detention center on the base and move the remainder of the men to the United States.
The two who left included Tariq al-Sawah, an Egyptian who was a relatively well-known prisoner. He was sent to Bosnia.
Al-Sawah admitted being an explosives trainer for al-Qaida and at one point faced charges of conspiracy and providing support for terrorism.
The other was Abd al-Aziz al-Suwaydi, who went to Montenegro, which his lawyer, David Remes, called an ideal country for the prisoner.
“He has a Western sensibility. He is open and friendly and looks European. When people pass him in the street, they will not even notice him,” Remes said.
