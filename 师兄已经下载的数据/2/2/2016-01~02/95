Australian News - Beijing's Hand Seen in Visa Issue Keeping Rights Activists Out of Religious Freedom Conference


Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng, who has worked on human rights issues in rural areas of China, and Uyghur activist Dolkun Isa will both miss the first Asia-Pacific Religious Freedom Forum because they couldn't legally enter Taiwan.


Chen Guangcheng, who now lives in the U.S., said he was invited by the forum's organizers, but did not get a visa from Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy over which authoritarian Beijing claims sovereignty.


"If we don't put the universal value of human rights in the right position, but continue to ignore it, we will spoil the dictators so they will not abide the law," he told RFA's Cantonese service.



 The Uyghurs are a mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority group that lives in northwestern China's Xinjiang region where it has complained about pervasive ethnic discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression by Beijing.


 In 2009, after the KMT regained control, the WUC said false reports circulated that Isa had entered Taiwan with 11 other Uyghurs ahead of the World Games, which took place in Kaohsiung in July that year, and would pose a security threat. In response, Taiwan issued a ban on Isa's travel to the country, it said.


Chen gained international recognition for organizing a landmark class-action lawsuit against authorities in China for excessive enforcement of the one-child policy. For the lawsuit, Chen was detained whether in prison or under house arrest until he fled in 2012 to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and eventually to the United States.


But his activism started earlier as Chen, who has been blind since childhood, first gained recognition as an advocate for the disabled and the poor.


Chen has also visited Taiwan before. In 2013 he address Taiwan's parliament where he was warmly greeted by more than 500 people who packed the parliamentary auditorium.
