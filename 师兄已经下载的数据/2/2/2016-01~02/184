Alaskan adventure with the world through Bears of the Last Frontier. It has been quite the journey. The film has been nearly two years in the making, and for both of us it has become an unforgettable part of our lives. Over the course of a year and a half we traveled well over 3000 miles across Alaska and shot 500 hours of footage for this epic three-hour PBS Nature series. We spent many, many months in bear country – piecing together the lives of these fascinating animals by observing and filming them, and by living in bear country, among the animals and people that share bear habitat.

The Fight For Survival - Africa Wildlife Documentary

The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savannah in southern Africa prolonging 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering considerably of Botswana and also parts of Namibia - formerly South West Africa - and South Africa. A semi-desert, with massive systems of exceptional grazing after great rainfalls, the Kalahari sustains a lot more animals and also plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There are percentages of rainfall and also the summertime temperature level is quite high. The driest areas often receive 110-- 200 millimetres (4.3-- 7.9 in) of rainfall each year, and also the wettest merely a little over 500 millimetres (20 in). The bordering Kalahari Container covers over 2,500,000 square kilometres (970,000 sq mi) prolonging further into Botswana, Namibia and also South Africa, and also encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Kalahari is the home of many migratory birds as well as pets. Formerly havens for wild animals from elephants to giraffes, as well as for killers such as lions and cheetahs, the riverbeds are now mainly grazing areas, though leopards as well as cheetahs could still be discovered.

Welcome to Top10Archive! Earth is a vast planet, massive to a degree that we may not quite comprehend yet. From an article published by National Geographic, humans have only discovered 15% of the species alive on our planet. The installment that follows will cover ten of those newly discovered species, gems that Mother Nature, up until recently, was able to hide from our prying eyes.

Award-winning wildlife documentary makers, Dereck and Beverley Joubert have spent the majority of the last 30 years surrounded by wilderness and wild animals. During that amount of time one is bound to see some incredible things. Luckily for us, they had a camera and know what to do with it. This clip shows some of the wildest, most unusual and intensive hunting sequences ever seen, the results of 30 dedicated years in the bush....

Wildlife includes all non-domesticated plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative.
Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is impacted by human activities.
Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways including the legal, social, and moral sense. This has been a reason for debate throughout recorded history. Religions have often declared certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment. Literature has also made use of the traditional human separation from wildlife.
