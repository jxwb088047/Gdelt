Also-Ran Trump urges Thugs to Knock 'the Crap' out of Protesters, will cover Legal Fees
Cenk Uygur | (The Young Turks Video Report) | – –
“Donald Trump has encouraged his followers to commit violence before. Now he’s taking it up a notch, offering to pick up the tab for any lawsuits incurred while beating down protesters. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down.
“Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told the crowd gathered at his campaign rally on Monday to “knock the crap” out of anybody who threw a tomato at him.
Trump said the event’s security staff told him there was a risk people would throw the juicy fruit.
“So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them,” Trump said at his rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
“I will pay for the legal fees. I promise,” he added. “They won’t be so much because the courts agree with us too.”

Desperate media circus sideshow distraction, Donald Trump, has commenced the inevitable decline.
Maybe he’s counting on a riot to excite the base.
Man, even the Nazis didn’t promise to cover legal fees. Next step, private death squads. White unemployment will vanish overnight… along with some other things.
Barratry and accessory before the fact. Trump is a criminal
@TheYoungTurks I’m from Brooklyn, and I know a thug from Queens when I see him. He’s a loud blowhard and also a coward.
When was the last time that actually happened? Back in the real America the neo-cons keep whining for?
Thank you to all of my supporters for your generosity and your encouragement of an independent press! Checks to
