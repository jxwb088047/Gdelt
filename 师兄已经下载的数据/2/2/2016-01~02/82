New App Fights Bad Vibes With Good - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 31, 2016Leave a Comment
As online threatening continues to be an issue, it turns out that there are some apps that are trying to combat this. HeartMob allows people to submit their bullying victim stories so others can bring them positive messages and vibes. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), Ana Kasparian, and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Launched today, HeartMob was created by anti-harassment organizationHollaback!. The group was behind one of 2014’s most viral videos, which showed a woman walking in New York City for 10 hours and all the crude comments she received. That video inspired many iterations (and parodies), and, most importantly, made a powerful statement about harassment in real life. Now Hollaback! has taken its efforts to the online frontlines, where a different kind of harassment plays out each day…
There are two ways to be an active HeartMob user: You can either sign up to help people who are getting harassed, or sign up to document and get support for your own harassment. If you’re signing up for yourself, you’ll be given a form to fill out with specifics regarding the incident, such as the platform where it occured (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), screenshots of the interactions, the type of harassment tactic and what you believe could be the motivation.”*
