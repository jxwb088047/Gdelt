What is the Gun Control about? 

This video will give you an idea of why the \"powers that be\" are constantly staging shootings in America to pass more stricter gun laws. (This is just the beginning).

The owners of America (Illuminati) don\'t really care THAT much that so many Americans are armed because they know that most people will surrender to their new world order dictatorship without a fight. 

But it will make their process towards full control and enslavement easier if less people have assault rifles. When they send their agents to search american homes (like in the movie Equilibrium), they would obviously rather not meet armed opposition and have a shoot-out. Many Americans will rather die fighting than surrender without a fight only to be sent off to the FEMA concentration camps.

I suggest everyone watches \"Illuminazi\" by Anthony J. Hilder. Will give you more knowledge about this specific matter....

If there has ever been a speech that everyone needs to see regarding Obama\'s plan to take our guns. This is the one! In this clip we see an army vet that serves as a police officer speak to the motion to repeal the \'Safe\' act at the Dutchess County Legislature New York State. His name is Aaron Weiss and he has quite a bit say. At some points he even tears up. It isn\'t until he speaks on his friend\'s passing away in war that his emotions get the best of him. We love what this young man has to say to the administration and their plans for disarming our citizens!...

Gun politics in the United States has long been among the most controversial issues in American politics. For the last several decades, the debate regarding both the restriction and availability of firearms within the United States has been characterized by a stalemate between an individual right to bear arms based on the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and the responsibility of government to prevent crime, maintain order and protect the wellbeing of its citizens. In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment protects the right of an individual to own a firearm for the purposes of self defense within the home, while at the same time reaffirming the constitutionality of a wide range of long standing gun control laws. Repeated polling has found that a majority of Americans believe the constitution ensures their right to own a gun, and a majority also supports stricter enforcement of current laws. However, only 43 percent believe new laws would be more effective than better enforcement of existing laws in reducing gun violence in the United States.
