ISIS In The Philippines: Islamic State Support Growing Despite Government Claims - by Julia Glum
The Islamic State group may be gathering strength in the Philippines, an island nation with a history of Muslim rebellions. The Japan Times reported Wednesday that there are signs of rapidly accelerating support for the terrorist group, aka ISIS, specifically in the southern Philippines.

It’s often frustrating that our intelligence agencies can’t seem to track down most of ISIS considering how active they are online. Anonymous has decided to join the fight. They want to dox ISIS and send their addresses to Seal Team 6 for the most uber pownage of all time. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"After the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for Friday’s wave of attacks that killed more than 130 people in Paris, the hactivist collective Anonymous declared war on the terrorist faction and its supporters.

\"Make no mistake: Anonymous is at war with Daesh,\" the enigmatic hacker group wrote on Twitter over the weekend, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Make no mistake: #Anonymous is at war with #Daesh. We won\'t stop opposing #IslamicState. We\'re also better hackers. #OpISIS

The group uploaded videos in multiple languages, including English and Italian, in which it vowed to \"neutralize\" the perpetrators of Friday\'s attacks.

\"We will not give up, we do not forgive,\" said a person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. \"Expect us.””*

Slavery, Terrorism and Islam: The Historical Roots and Contemporary Threat.. 
Adapted from Dr. Peter Hammond\'s book 

Islam is not a religion nor is it a cult. It is a complete system. Islam has religious, legal, political, economic and military components. The religious component is a beard for all the other components.

Islamization occurs when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their so-called \"religious rights.\"

When politically correct and culturally diverse societies agree to \"the reasonable\" Muslim demands for their \"religious rights,\" they also get the other components under the table. Here\'s how it works (percentages source CIA: The World Fact Book (2007)). As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their colorful uniqueness:

United States -- Muslim 1.0%
Australia -- Muslim 1.5%
Canada -- Muslim 1.9%
China -- Muslim 1%-2%
Italy -- Muslim 1.5%
Norway -- Muslim 1.8%

At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:

Denmark -- Muslim 2%
Germany -- Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%
Spain -- Muslim 4%
Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. They will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby secur...

The core religious allegory of Islam starts with Muhammad’s revelations in the caves and ends with the death of 4th successor Ali, almost 40 years later. It is analogous to the Last Suppers, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ in Christianity. In the lifetime of Muhammad, his community gained control over the Arabian Peninsula. And though he passed away in 632 AD the religious story doesn’t end there. But it is continued through his four closest followers, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali, together they formed the Rashidun, which means the Rightly Guided One’s. Together they established the first Islamic state, the Caliphate. In just 30 years the Rashidun Caliphate had conquered all of Persia, Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Levant and even parts of the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia. In some ways, this new state resembled a democracy. All four leaders were elected by the council representatives. But the transition of power between these leaders was not an easy one. And all of it started with the death of a prophet.

Philippines: Abu Sayyaf Terror Group Threatens to Kill Two German Hostages Over Isis Airstrikes and Ransom

An al-Qaida-linked Filipin

German Abu Sayyaf hostages Stefan Viktor Okonek and Henrite Dielen

Abu Sayyaf, which started kidnapping foreigners in the early 2000s, published a message on Twitter saying it would kill one of the two hostages if its demands were not met within 15 days, according to SITE Intelligence group.

\"A message attributed to the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf Group threatened that two German hostages will be killed unless it is paid a ransom and Germany stops its support to the United States against the Islamic State (IS),\" SITE reported.

The German nationals, doctor Stefan Viktor Okonek and his companion Henrite Dielen, were reportedly abducted at gunpoint by the group from a yacht between Malaysia\'s Sabah state on Borneo Island and the western Philippine province of Palawan in April and then taken by boat to predominantly Muslim Sulu, 950km south of Manila.

The Islamist militants are holding about 10 hostages in the Sulu jungles, including two European birdwatchers, a Japanese and some Filipinos, according to AP reports. The Philippine extremists demand a ransom of 250 million pesos (£3.4 million) for the German...
