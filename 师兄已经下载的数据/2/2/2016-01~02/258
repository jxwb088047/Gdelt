The Democratic Party’s romance with Wall Street may finally be breaking up. In the past 10 days, a diverse group of Democratic senators scuttled Larry Summers’s candidacy...
Poor Lawrence Summers, he doesn't get to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, aka the czar of the world's economic order. It would have been the penultimate reward for a career advanced by a string of stunning failures, but this time around some key senators needed to confirm the president's likely choice had the gumption to say they would not be fooled again.

Racism, wealth inequality, Wall Street greed, and perpetual wars are perhaps the biggest moral dilemmas we face as a nation.
