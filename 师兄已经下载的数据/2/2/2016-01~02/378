 Earlier this week, Gawker reporter J.K. Trotter highlighted a new set of documents exposing the inner workings of Beltway journalism. Using documents procured through FOIA, Trotter showed how then-Atlantic contributing editor Marc Ambinder sought an early copy of a July 2009 foreign policy speech by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Ambinder appealed to Philippe Reines, […] ...

Mike Allen is perhaps the best connected reporter in Washington, D.C. Newly leaked emails show that he made arrangements with the State Department to ensure a softball interview for Chelsea Clinton. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Gawker has received another batch of Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines’ emails with reporters while working for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Among Reines’ more frequent correspondents, it turns out, is Mike Allen. In an email dated January 10, 2013 and addressed to Reines, then serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Allen floated the idea of interviewing Clinton’s adult daughter, Chelsea, during an upcoming brunch hosted by Politico. Attempting to secure an interview with the daughter of a likely presidential candidate is, of course, far from unheard of. What makes Allen’s ask unusual is that he appears to assure Reines that he’ll produce totally positive coverage of Chelsea Clinton…”*

\"State Department spokesperson Philippe Reines has issued a wry declaration of war on Fox News correspondent Justin Fishel.

In December, Fishel followed the lead of many conservative outlets in questioning the department\'s announcement that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had fallen and suffered a concussion that made her unable to testify about the September attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.

\"It seems that she has not been available to testify on the Benghazi situation on some very key dates, including the Sunday after 9/11 and now this Thursday,\" he said during a daily press briefing, echoing several other Fox commentators.\"*

Fox News strongly hinted they thought Hilary Clinton was faking her medical condition to get out of testifying about Benghazi. Wrong again, Bob! In a sarcastic letter, the State Department let Fox News know exactly how they felt.. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Host, Turner Classic Movies), and John Iadarola (Host, TYT University) break it down.

A federal judge has turned down a request from the website Gawker to force former Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines to explain why he had work-related emails in a private account and how he decided which messages to include in 20 boxes of records he handed over to the State Department in July. Following a 50-minute hearing in Washington on Thursday morning, U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson did not rule out requiring such a filing at some point but said she was not convinced it was necessary now.

Philippe I. Reines (Born November 25, 1969) joined the State Department as a Senior Advisor to United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she was sworn into office in January 2009, and was later promoted to the position of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State.
In its Dec 2009 profile of Hillary Clinton, Vogue magazine described him as Clinton's "Michael Clayton-esque image man and fixer." In March 2010, The Washington Post's WhoRunsGov included him in its Power 25: Press series, and in July 2010, Politico included Reines in their 50 Politicos to Watch list, categorizing him as a "fixer."
On March 29 Politico ran a scathing piece blaming Reines for one of Clinton's early gaffes as Secretary of State, misspelling the Russian translation of the word "Reset" on a gag button presented to Clinton's Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.
Through January 2009, Reines served as Senior Advisor & Press Secretary for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
As the primary point of contact between Senator Clinton's official office and the national press corps, Reines served as one of Senator Clinton's primary spokesmen, and was responsible for many of her interviews and media appearances. In 2003, Reines helped orchestrate the media campaign and seven-month book tour that accompanied the release of Living History, Senator Clinton's bestselling memoir of her time in the White House.[citation needed]
