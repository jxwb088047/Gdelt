China's western region of Xinjiang has set new rules to boost "ethnic solidarity", state media said Friday, amid roiling violence between Muslim Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese that has left hundreds dead in recent years.The government has blamed unrest in Xinjiang on Islamist militants, though rights groups and exiles say anger at Chinese controls on the religion and culture of the Uighurs is more to blame than any cohesive militant group.The rules have been adopted amid widespread reports of government policies that constrain religious and cultural practices.China denies any repression in Xinjiang.
