Xinjiang’s foreign trade grows 40% over 5 years | Customs Today Newspaper
URUMQI: Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in northwest China has made 770 billion yuan ($116.8 billion) from foreign trade from 2011 to 2015, up 41.5 percent over the previous five years.
According to Urumqi Customs Office, the region’s trade growth had slowed during the past five years.
Foreign trade volume for the region totaled $19.7 billion in 2015, down 28.9 percent year on year. Exports shrank by 25.4 percent to settle at $17.5 billion, while imports plunged by 48.2 percent to $2.2 billion.
Customs data showed a decline of more than 40 percent in trade with Kazakhstan in 2015, but growth of 180 percent with the United States last year. Electromechanical products, textiles and shoes accounted for the majority of export while the region also imported large quantities of electromechanical and agricultural products as well as paper pulp.
Customs statistician Chen Guoliang was upbeat about the outlook for Xinjiang’s exports thanks to supportive policies from the central and regional governments.
