You are in a war for your mind, whether you believe it or not. More than anything…. the ruling elite have been bombarding the controlled narrative that overwhelmed your rational consciousness,your subconscious, unconscious, and ultimately your super consciousness long before you were even born. They have been using a two faced mind control technique known as the Hegelian dialectic to control both sides of an issue to keep you locked in a cage of powerlessness. That is how the only vote standing in the pathway of Obama’s lame duck New World Order policies was snuffed out without most people asking any questions.

That is why the details are so important to the awakened citizen. Wayne Madsen writes “Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia could not have died in a more corrupt county than Presidio Co., Texas.

On this Monday, February 15 edition of the Alex Jones show we cover the apparent assassination of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia over the weekend. Scalia was found dead at a remote ranch in Texas with a pillow over his head. We look into the highly irregular and premature conclusion that Scalia died of “natural causes” that have prompted calls for an autopsy and toxicological reports and a report that Obama learned about the death hours before it was publicly announced. We also revisit a decades old revelation presented by Senators Frank Church and John Tower that the CIA had developed a poison dart gun that causes cancer and heart attacks. We also cover the push for war in Syria and the wider Middle East as Saudi Arabia amasses 350,000 soldiers for a planned invasion.

“It didn’t take long after news broke that Justice Antonin Scalia had died at a Texas hunting lodge before conspiracy theorists came to the “logical” conclusion that the 79-year-old jurist with health problems had been murdered.

Even before My San Antonio reported that lodge owner John Poindexter said, “We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,” people began speculating online that Scalia had been murdered.

According to Alex Jones, Scalia had likely been murdered by President Obama in much the same manner the president killed conservative gadfly Andrew Breitbart, who died on a Brentwood sidewalk from a heart attack.”*...

Antonin Gregory Scalia (i/skəˈlijə/; born March 11, 1936) is an American jurist who serves as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. As the longest-serving justice currently on the Court, Scalia is the Senior Associate Justice. Appointed to the Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, Scalia has been described as the intellectual anchor of the Court's conservative wing.
Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and attended public grade school and Catholic high school in New York City, where his family had moved. He attended Georgetown University as an undergraduate and obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from Harvard Law School. After spending six years in a Cleveland law firm, he became a law school professor. In the early 1970s, he served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, first at minor administrative agencies, and then as an assistant attorney general. He spent most of the Carter years teaching at the University of Chicago, where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling Federalist Society. In 1982, he was appointed as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by President Ronald Reagan.
