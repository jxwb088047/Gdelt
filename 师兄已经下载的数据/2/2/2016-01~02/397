Xinjiang welcomes labor-intensive plants for more jobs
China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region aims to cultivate more heavy labor employers in the next five years.
Medium and small enterprises are also on the welcome list.
With abundant resources of cotton and labor, Xinjiang will try to attract textile and clothing manufacturers with the support of policy, capital, and training, during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).
It will also encourage as many as 200,000 residents to find jobs in textile mills or clothing companies in eastern inland areas during the same period.
The westernmost region is the biggest cotton cropper in China, harvesting 3.5 million tons of cotton last year, 62.5 percent of the national yield. Textile and garment industries contributed 130,000 new jobs in Xinjiang during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015).
In Tarim Basin, one of the region's principal cotton producers, many villagers left farmland for factories where they earn stable income.
Currently, 1.85 million people, 8 percent of Xinjiang's population, are living in poverty.
