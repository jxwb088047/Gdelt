Being prosecuted on charges of organized crime, a group of 181 Uighur Turks in East Turkestan were arrested by Chinese forces in another large-scale operation, as part of the Government’s coercive policies against the ethnic group.  
With repressive policies being applied to Uighur's in Eastern Turkestan, 181 Uighur's have been detained by Chinese police for being part of an organised crime group.
In operations on 26 May 2015, Chinese occupying forces have detained 181 Uighurs in Eastern Turkestan.
According to the government press, 112 of the detainees were searched by police and were part of an organised crime group.
Eastern Turkestan activists and refugees abroad have reported that Chinese police have applied excessive repressive policies of the Chinese police against Uighur Muslims. The Chinese government accuses Muslim Uighurs of attempting to re-establish the independent state of Eastern Turkestan.
