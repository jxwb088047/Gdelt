North Korea says it can make mini-nuclear weapons - Worldnews.com

North Korea claimed Wednesday it has been able to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a missile – a development that, if verified, would mark a major advance in its military capabilities and the threat it can pose to the world.

Victor Cha was President George W. Bush’s top advisor on North Korea and participated in the Six-Party Talks, in which the US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea tried to negotiate with the regime of late leader Kim Jong-il to halt North Korea’s nuclear program. The talks were unsuccessful, and North Korea’s nuclear capabilities have never been greater.

In January, North Korea conducted a nuclear test for the fourth time since 2009, successfully detonating what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb. A month later, North Korea launched a satellite into orbit, violating an international ban on ballistic missile testing. The UN Security Council recently voted to enact harsh new sanctions, which prompted young leader Kim Jong-un to publicly order his military to ready their nukes for use at any time.

VICE News sat down with Cha, now a senior adviser and the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to talk about North Korea’s nuclear threats, Pyongyang’s uneasy alliance with China, and the state of the Kim regime.

Meet Kim Jong II, leader of North Korea - a nation imprisoned by poverty and with a population so hungry, people eat bugs and grass. Now this megalomaniacal dictator is holding the civilized world hostage with what many see as a cunning strategy of extortion, threatening to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons. It\'s a strategy by which the United States has indicated it cannot abide. In a joint production between the Discovery Channel and the New York Times, go behind the headlines to discover the little-understood origins and almost-stranger-than-truth facets of this dangerous confrontation. See a side of Kim Jong Il rarely revealed - his love of slasher flicks and his affinity for prostitutes - and learn why the United States may have no other palatable option than to play ball with Kim, allowing him to continue his weapons development program. It\'s quite literally a race against time - if North Korea, as it promises, goes into nuclear production mode, giving Kim as many as 10 nuclear bombs within six months, it would create a destabilizing offensive nuclear capability that could touch off a regional arms race...and even nuclear war. It\'s a game of international intrigue and high-stakes military strategy. But more importantly, it\'s the story of destitute North Korea and its bizarre leader, and how he has brought the U.S. and the world face-to-face with the unimaginable.

this film details the history behind what brought North Korea into a nuclear power. In summary, Kim Jong Un came to power after they fought away the Japanese after WWII. The Soviets and the Americans div...

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. and South Korea will begin their largest ever joint military drills on Monday. In response, North Korea has threatened to launch a \'pre-emptive nuclear strike of justice.\'

This year\'s U.S.-South Korea annual military drill will be twice the size of last year, involving more than 300,000 South Korean soldiers and 15,000 U.S. troops, according to the BBC.

\"We will carry out these exercises while keeping tabs on signs of North Korean provocations. If the North provokes us during this exercise, the U.S. and our troops will retaliate with an attack ten-fold stronger,\" a South Korean official told Yonhap News.

The annual exercises are intended to warn North Korea against its provocations while the North considers them a rehearsal for invasion.

\"Our targets are the U.S. bases in South Korea and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region as well as the U.S. mainland. We have state-of-the-art weapons that no country in the world has previously possessed that can bombard the U.S. in any way we want,\" the \"Rodong Sinmun,\" the official newspaper of News Korea\'s ruling Workers\' Party of Korea published on Sunday.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been growing since North Korea tested a nuclear device in January, followed by a rocket launch.

The threat was a response to new UN sanctions announced this week against his regime. For now at least, most experts say the regime is still unable to make them small enough to fit in a missile.

North Korea Hydrogen Bomb Test Successful ww3 Nuclear tests hydrogen bomb 5.1 Earthquake North Korea Hydrogen Bomb Test is Successful North Korea hydrogen bomb test 5.1 Earthquake North Korea Hydrogen Bomb Test is Successful VIDEO North Korea successful hydrogen bomb test Seoul (AFP) - North Korea said Wednesday it had carried out a \"successful\" hydrogen bomb test, a claim that -- if true -- massively raises the stakes over the hermit state\'s banned nuclear programme.

In a surprise announcement Pyongyang said it had carried out a hydrogen blast.

\"The republic\'s first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10:00 am on January 6, 2016, based on the strategic determination of the Workers\' Party,\" a state television news reader said.

A hydrogen, or thermonuclear device, uses fusion in a chain reaction that results in a far more powerful explosion than the fission blast generated by uranium or plutonium alone.

Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un had suggested Pyongyang had already developed a hydrogen bomb -- although the claim was greeted with scepticism by international experts.

North Korea has hinted before at the possession of \"stronger, more powerful\" weapons, but Kim\'s remarks were believed to be the first direct reference to an H-bomb.

The announcement by North Korean state media came two days before Kim\'s birthday and just over four years after he succeeded his father as leader of the Stalinist state.

Suspicions over a possible nuclear test -- Pyongyang\'s fourth -- were first raised by seismologists who said they had detected a 5.1 magnitude...

North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) has declared that it has nuclear weapons and is believed by many to have nuclear weapons. The CIA assesses that North Korea also has a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons. North Korea was a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but withdrew in 2003, citing the failure of the United States to fulfill its end of the Agreed Framework, a 1994 agreement between the states to limit North Korea's nuclear ambitions, begin normalization of relations, and help North Korea supply some energy needs through nuclear reactors.
On October 9, 2006, the North Korean government issued an announcement that it had successfully conducted a nuclear test for the first time. Both the United States Geological Survey and Japanese seismological authorities detected an earthquake with a preliminary estimated magnitude of 4.3 in North Korea, corroborating some aspects of the North Korean claims.
In April 2009, reports surfaced that North Korea has become a "fully fledged nuclear power", an opinion shared by IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted another nuclear test, which is believed to have been the cause of a magnitude 4.7 seismic event. Although there is no official information about the test's location, it is believed that it happened in the north-eastern region near Kilju, the site of North Korea's first nuclear test.
