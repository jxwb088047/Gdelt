Shock claim: Turkey provided 10,000 passports to ISIS
TEL AVIV  Egypt is accusing Turkey of providing more than 10,000 Turkish passports to members of ISIS, the Islamic State, to facilitate travel of fighters across the region.
An Egyptian intelligence official who asked not to be named told WND his country delivered a report to the U.S. documenting the astonishing claim.
The official further charged that Istanbul is serving as the headquarters for ISIS planning.
Turkey continues to allow free passage to Iraq and Syria to IS fighters, the official added.
If the Turkish passport charge is true, it would present a worldwide ISIS travel threat.
Already, there have been major passport concerns regarding ISIS and its sympathizers.
Earlier this month, a French senate report showed about 47 percent of European jihadists known to have traveled to ISIS-held territory hold French passports.
Report: More than 100,000 fake Turkish passports given to ISIL
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militants were given more than 100,000 fake Turkish passports in order to travel to Turkey and then enter Syria to join ISIL, a daily reported on Thursday.
According to a story in the Meydan daily, A.G., an aide of Nurali T., a Uyghur Turk working for ISIL to provide militants with passports worldwide, Nurali T.'s office in İstanbul's Zeytinburnu district functions as an ISIL passport office. Each passport was sold for $200, A.G. told Meydan.
More than 50,000 Uyghur Turks came to Turkey with these fake passports from China via Thailand and Malaysia and entered Syria after staying a day in İstanbul, Meydan reported. A.G. claimed that most of the Uyghurs with fake passports were caught by police in Turkish airports but they were released in Turkey after their passports were seized. The Uyghurs' release in Turkey is due to a secret [little-known] Turkish law on Uyghur Turks. More than 50,000 Uyghurs joined ISIL through this method, A.G. added.

100,000? Did not expect there were that many in ISIS.
And for how many of these did the Obama administration provide a US visa?
Well, they are just the last in a long line of mujahadeen movements, that draws radical muslim fighters from around the world. The difference here, though, is they have claimed territory, are operating as a government, and have declared a caliphate. That’s an exciting development to the radicals, so they are surely drawing more foreign recruits than the mujahadeen in the Balkans, Afghanistan, or Iraq did.
Saaayyyyy Is this the same Turkey that wouldn’t allow US troops passage at the start of the Iraq war? That Turkey?
May be time to stop passage of Turks on American planes.
Why is that shocking? Obola’s been supplying ISIS with weapons through Turkey since Kadafi went down. Why would this surprise anyone who’s paying attention? Obolas is supportive of an Islamic caliphate and is doing everything he can to make it happen.
I wonder how many of these Turkish passport holders are setting up on the US border near Cuidad Juarez?
I would believe this if it wasn’t an article from World Nut Daily.
Nowhere near as big as Boko Haram. They are the ones we should be watching out for..
Of course. How else can they be traveling back and forth so easily?
Like most towelhead “allies “ they take all they can get from us while helping the towelhead cause.

Not clear if these are Turkish passports, or fake Turkish passports.

And Turkey, along with Obama will now be indoctrinating them and training them in larger numbers in America with the official blessing of POTUS.
