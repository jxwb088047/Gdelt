A legendary tale of two great kingdoms fought over a beautiful princess, and it's an ancient city shrouded by time. But the princess is not Helen, and the city is not Troy. They are still writing the script for "Loulan", but the plotline is fascinating to begin with: two great peoples in fierce contention over a princess, and set in an ancient city on the Silk Road more than two thousand years ago.
"Twilight" film director, Catherine Hardwicke, plans to shoot the film - the first in a trilogy - in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and in Beijing."It will be a beautiful love story but it will also be getting us into a culture of the time, around 200 BC on the Silk Road, the romantic Silk Road."
"So we've been studying, we've been to the museum in Urumqi, we've been finding all about the history of the region, which is a mix of all these vibrant cultures coming from the East and the West. So this is a very cool story about the Princess of Loulan," said Catherine.'Loulan', the story of a princess contested between the warriors of the Han people and nomad Huns, is set in a desert city of the same name that mysteriously disappeared hundreds of years ago.

"I loved the idea of this mix of cultures and these young kids that are in love and that are struggling with very heavy issues of war and peace," said the director.Filming on this 50 million-dollar China-U.S. co-production is expected to start in August 2016, with a target release date of late 2017 or early 2018.
