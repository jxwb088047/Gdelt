Another Police Shooting Of An Unarmed Man. FINAL JUDGMENT
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 7, 20151 Comment
Cenk Uygur (host of The Young Turks) discusses footage of Officer Michael Slager shooting unarmed black man in the back in South Carolina. After one of these shootings the question always arises is it a few bad apples or is the problem systemic. Cenk makes a final judgment on police shootings. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
The cop was completely in the wrong overall. As far as handcuffing a suspect, you should ALWAYS handcuff a suspect that has attacked you. Regardless of what the outcome is, you do this to protect yourself from further attack. Just because a suspect is currently cooperating doesnâ€™t mean that he will continue to do so. That being said, that cop is a scumbag. you should never shoot an UNARMED person in the BACK!! WTF! Actions like this give law enforcement agents everywhere a bad name. No wonder no one trusts cops.
