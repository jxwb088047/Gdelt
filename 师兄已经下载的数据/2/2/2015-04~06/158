China urging Uighurs to give up fasting in Ramazan
Karachi, June 16 (ANI): China's local government in Xinjiang is urging Uighur people who follow Islamic faith to give up fasting in Ramazan.
According to Dawn News, civil servants, students and teachers in particular have been reportedly given notices to give up observing the holy month of Ramazan.
The month of Ramazan is a sensitive time in China's Xinjiang following an uptick in deadly attacks blamed by Beijing on Islamist militants over the past three years in which hundreds have died.
Other government institutions have given similar instructions in the country.
China has around 20 million Muslims spread throughout the country, only a portion of which are Uighur. (ANI)
