http://democracynow.org - A new report from the Israeli group Breaking the Silence on Israel’s policy of indiscriminate fire during the 2014 Gaza assault comes just a week after a United Nations probe confirmed Israeli forces conducted direct attacks on its facilities in Gaza during last summer’s offensive. The attacks took place despite repeated notifications with the GPS coordinates of U.N. sites to Israeli forces. Palestinians have vowed to bring the findings to the International Criminal Court, which it officially joined last month. We discuss the implications of Palestine’s accession to the ICC with two guests: Ambassador Nabil Abuznaid, head of the Palestinian Mission to the Netherlands, and John Dugard, former U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories and emeritus professor of international law at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

The Palestinian Authority has submitted a first batch of evidence to the International Criminal Court, detailing Israel’s alleged war crimes.

The file handed in to ICC prosecutors includes two files; one of which refers to crimes Israel committed during last year’s deadly war on Gaza. The other has documented the occupation of Palestinian land, including Israeli settlement activities and information about Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Maliki says the evidence makes a compelling case for the prompt opening of an investigation into Israeli war crimes and seeking justice for the victims. Back in January, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda launched a preliminary probe to see if there’s enough evidence for a full war crimes investigation into Israel’s last year war on Gaza. The 50-day war claimed the lives of about 22-hundred Palestinians and left thousands more injured and traumatized. Nearly 100-thousand homes were destroyed in the Israeli attacks.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Maliki says the evidence makes a compelling case for the prompt opening of an investigation into Israeli war crimes and seeking justice for the victims. Back in January, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda launched a preliminary probe to see if there’s enough evidence for a full war crimes investigation into Israel’s last year war on Gaza. The 50-day war claimed the lives of about 22-hundred Palestinians and left thousands more injured and traumatized. Nearly 100-thousand homes were destroyed in the Israeli attacks.
