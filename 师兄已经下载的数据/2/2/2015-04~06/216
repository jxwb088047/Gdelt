Saudi Arabia, spearheading a coalition of nine Arab states, began carrying out airstrikes in neighbouring Yemen on 25 March 2015, heralding the start of a military intervention codenamed Operation Decisive Storm. The intervention began in response to requests for assistance from the internationally recognized but domestically contested Yemeni government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The request was due to a Houthi offensive aimed at its provisional capital of Aden. President Hadi fled Aden, left the country and went to Saudi Arabia as Saudi Arabia and its allies launched airstrikes in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
Fighter jets from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain are also taking part in the operation. Somalia has made its airspace, territorial waters and military bases available for the coalition to use. The United States has provided intelligence and logistical support, including search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots. It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states. Additionally, Pakistan was called on by Saudi Arabia to join the coalition, but its parliament voted to maintain neutrality. Despite this, Pakistan agreed to provide warships to help the coalition enforce an arms embargo against the Houthis....

A massive explosion from an airstrike in Yemen’s capital left at least fifteen people dead and wounded dozens more on Monday, medical sources told Reuters. 

The attack was the latest -- and strongest -- in a series of air strikes led by Saudi Arabia in the Sana’a area. 

Saudi fighter planes bombed an area of Faj Attan mountain and targeted a military base that was housing scud missiles. The mountain sits near the Hadda district, which is home to embassies and the presidential palace.

The explosion at the missile base shattered windows and tore holes in buildings and cars. 

According to Reuters, at least 15 people died in the blast. Al Jazeera reported more than 300 people were wounded.

One witness at a local hospital told Reuters victims with debris wounds crowded the emergency room. 

Saudi-led strikes have been targeting areas where Houthi rebels have increased their power, including in suburbs of the capital. 

Since January of 2014, Houthi rebels have moved south through Yemen. Their forces are now in cities from the northern Saada province to the southern area of Aden. 

On Monday, witnesses reported hearing anti-aircraft artillery throughout the area following the explosion.

The Saudi Arabia-led coalition carrying out attacks against the Houthis in Yemen has failed to investigate its apparently unlawful airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians. The United States is also obligated to investigate attacks in which it played a role that allegedly violated the laws of war.

Human Rights Watch examines in detail 10 apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes that killed at least 309 civilians and wounded more than 414 between April and August 2015. According to the United Nations, most of the 2,600 civilian deaths since the coalition began its military campaign against the Houthis in late March have been from coalition airstrikes. Human Rights Watch is unaware of any investigations by Saudi Arabia, other coalition members, or the US into these or other allegedly unlawful strikes, or of any compensation for victims or their families....

Zeid bin Ra’ad said the deadly Saudi raids on Yemen show the Kingdom’s repeated failure in preventing such incidents. He said Riyadh is QUOTE- responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together. The attack targeting a busy market was one of the deadliest since Saudi Arabia launched its war on its impoverished neighbor almost a year ago. Saudi warplanes have been pounding Yemeni towns and cities - including residential areas- on almost daily basis. More than 8500 Yemenis, mostly civilians, have been killed so far. Millions more are facing in a dire humanitarian situation. Riyadh has defied calls by international rights bodies to end the aggression.
