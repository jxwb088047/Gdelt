99rise Tapes Protest In Supreme Court
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 3, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the planned action by the Supreme Court against activist group 99rise for constant interruptions.
Five were arrested for contempt of court on April 1st for interrupting a supreme court session that was hearing oral arguments about bankruptcy law. A spokesperson for the group 99rise claiming responsibility for the interruptions stated that the activist group sought to combat what it sees as massive corruption within the current United States Governments. 99rise currently seeks a reversal of the ruling made in a Citizens United Case as well as the court’s decision in McCutcheon v. FEC. The Court is moving to take action against the group as it illegally recorded the Supreme court proceedings, a felony under current law.
This is only one of several videos in recent years that has surfaced to show the court in action.”
