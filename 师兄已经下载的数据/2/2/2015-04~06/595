The British supermodel hit the headlines after it emerged she had to be escorted off her flight last weekend

It\'s been a few months since Jeremy Clarkson was sensationally given the boot by the BBC following a row over steak, and judging by his latest comments the former Top Gear presenter can finally see the funny side.

Referring to Kate Moss losing her temper on an easyJet flight home reportedly because she was hungry, Clarkson joked: \"It seems possible that Kate Moss flipped while on an easyJet flight this week because she was hungry.

Writing in his column for The Sun, he continued: \"Hmm. I\'m a big fan of Kate but to lose your rag just because you can\'t get something to eat is unforgiveable. Oh, hang on a minute...\"

The British supermodel was escorted off her flight over the weekend, after allegedly calling the pilot a \"basic b**ch,\"and swigging vodka from the bottle.

While witnesses also came forward claiming Kate lost it when the cabin crew ran out of sandwiches for passengers.

An onlooker told The Sun they heard furious Kate yell: \"It\'s f***ing all right for them to eat pasta when we\'re hungry.\"

According to the paper, Kate had lived on veggie drinks for the previous five days at the detox centre in Turkey and was ravenous on her way home.

An eyewitness said Kate was irritable from the moment she got on the plane after being separated from her pals.

\"She was behaving ridiculously and effing and blinding her head off,\" he said. \"I had two teenage daughters with me who were very shocked at her language.

The supermodel, 41, reportedly lashed out at the pilot after returning from her week of detoxing in Turkey

Kate Moss told the pilot of her EasyJet flight she was a “basic b****” before being escorted off.

According to fellow passengers she was drinking vodka from her luggage after being denied alcohol aboard the flight, report the MailOnline.

The supermodel, 41, was returning to London Luton airport from a detox retreat in Bodrum on Sunday afternoon when the incident occurred.

\'Basic b****\' is an American slang term used to describe an unoriginal woman – typically a fan of mainstream music or products.

A passenger revealed: “She called the pilot a \"basic b****\" as police led her off the plane, she was a little drunk and had a disagreement with another passenger on the flight as she was refused alcohol and then went to serve her own vodka from her cabin luggage.

“But she was not aggressive to anyone and was funny really, the easyJet crew was acting out of proportion.”

It is understood her behaviour on board the EasyJet plane led to police meeting the flight when it landed at 4.13pm Sunday.

Police confirmed they were called to the flight after reports of a \'disruptive\' passengers - but no arrest was made.

Kate Moss bears cleavage as she\'s pictured for first time after being escorted off EasyJet flight

The supermodel put on a brave face as she was snapped with Vivienne Westwood at an event at Lou Lou\'s tonight

Kate Moss has been snapped for the first time after she was escorted off an EasyJet flight after allegedly drinking from her hand luggage on board.

The supermodel is said to have branded the pilot a \'basic b****\' as she was led off a flight from Bodrum in Turkey to Luton after apparently drinking vodka pulled from her cabin luggage.

However the star put a brave face on tonight as she joined her fashion friend Vivienne Westwood at Another Magazine\'s party at Lou Lou\'s.

Showing off major cleavage in a low-cut black top and trousers, the star failed to smile as she passed cameras.

With her hair down, the stunner flaunted her slim figure and looked as glamorous as ever at the star-studded bash.

The blonde beauty had been flying back from Turkey where she had been celebrating the 50th birthday of actress friend Sadie Frost at the LifeCo Clinic spa when the incident happened.

An EasyJet spokeswoman refused to confirm whether Ms Moss had been banned from future flights with the budget airline, but insisted the model had \"absolutely not\" received any special treatment.

She said passengers who were escorted from planes were sometimes banned from flying again with the company while others were not.

The spokeswoman said: \"It is really done on an individual basis depending on what takes place on board.

\"It does happen that disruptive passengers are banned but it is done ...

Supermodel Kate Moss was escorted from an easyJet flight by police following reports she was being \"disruptive\".
The Croydon-born catwalk star was met by officers when her flight from Bodrum in Turkey landed at Luton airport.
But no complaints were made and she was not arrested.
A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: \"We were called to assist staff in escorting a passenger from a flight arriving into Luton airport this afternoon.
\"The passenger had been reported as being disruptive on the flight.
\"Officers attended and escorted the passenger from the plane. No formal complaints were made against her and she was not arrested.\"
An easyJet spokeswoman confirmed that police met flight EZY2232 from Bodrum to Luton \"due to the behaviour of a passenger onboard\".
The 41-year-old, who made an estimated £4.6m last year, was flying with the budget airline on Sunday afternoon.
Moss has spent more than half her life in the public eye after she was famously discovered by Storm model agency founder Sarah Doukas aged 14 at JFK airport.
She rarely gives interviews but has spoken about the toll her work took on her, especially in her early years in the industry.
She told Vanity Fair she had a nervous breakdown while she was still a teenager while working on a campaign for Calvin Klein in the early 1990s.
But Moss recovered and her career has gone from strength to strength. Last year, she featured in 18 pages, as well as the cover, of Playboy magazine to celebrate her 40th birthday.

Kate Moss (born 16 January 1974) is an English model who is known for her waifish figure and popularising the heroin chic look in the 1990s. She is also known for her controversial private life, high profile relationships, party lifestyle, and drug use. Moss changed the look of modelling and started a global debate on eating disorders, and her role in size zero fashion. In 2007, she came 2nd on the Forbes top-earning models list, estimated to have earned $9 million in one year.
Moss was born in Addiscombe, Croydon, London to Linda Rosina (Shepherd), a barmaid, and Peter Edward Moss, a travel agent. Kate has a younger brother named Nick and a half-sister named Lottie (Charlotte) and half-brother. Moss' parents divorced when she was 13. She attended Ridgeway Primary School and Riddlesdown Collegiate, but most commonly known as Riddlesdown High School, in Purley. She was not noted for her academic success but she did excel at sport.
Moss was discovered in 1988 at the age of 14 by Sarah Doukas, the founder of Storm Model Management, at JFK Airport in New York City, after a holiday in the Bahamas. Moss's career began when Corinne Day shot black-and-white photographs of her, styled by Melanie Ward, for British magazine The Face when she was 16, in a photo shoot titled "The 3rd Summer of Love". Day discovered Kate Moss when she was a young and unknown model and described the pictures that she took of Moss as ‘dirty realism’ or ‘grunge’.Moss then went on to become the "anti-supermodel" of the 1990s[citation needed] in contrast to the "supermodels" of the moment[citation needed], such as Cindy Crawford, Elle Macpherson, Claudia Schiffer, and Naomi Campbell, who were known[citation needed] for their curvaceous and tall figures.
