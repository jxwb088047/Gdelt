Prosecutors in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are investigating Yin Mingkui, head of the region's welfare lottery center, for allegedly taking bribes, said the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) Monday.
Yin is also a senior official of the civil affairs department of the regional government.
He has been placed under compulsory measures, according to the SPP, though it did not specify which measures had been taken.
Compulsory measures may include summons by force, bail, residential surveillance, detention and arrest.
