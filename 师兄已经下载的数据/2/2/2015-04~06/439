伦敦中使馆外6月4日晚7时将烛光纪念“八九·六四” | CND刊物和论坛
To mark the 26th anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, a candlelit vigil will be held outside the Chinese Embassy in London on June 4th. We will read out the names of the citizens who were killed in the Massacre by the army of the CCP.
While there are Tiananmen prisoners who have been kept in prison all these years since they were locked up immediately after the Massacre, there are over two dozen Tiananmen participants who have been imprisoned in recent years, including Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, activist Chen Yunfei, lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and journalist Gao Yu. There will be an interactive street theatre – all welcome to participate – to recount their stories.
The courage of the tank man has never died. It has manifested itself in the rights defending movements across China, in the struggle for freedom of the Tibetan and Uyghur peoples, in the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong.
Date: Thursday 4 June, 7pm – 9pm
Venue: outside the Chinese Embassy, 49-59 Portland Place, London W1B 1JL
Nearest tubes: Great Portland Street, Oxford Circus
