Death of Boy in Thailand Highlights Plight of Hundreds of Uyghur Detainees
Five months after the death in custody of a three-year old ethnic Uyghur boy in southern Thailand, questions remain over the circumstances leading to his demise and the conditions facing some 370 other Uyghur refugees detained for more than a year after fleeing northwestern China’s Xinjiang region.Abdullah Abduweli had been receiving treatment for tuberculosis—a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs—for around two months at a hospital in Songkhla province’s Hat Yai city before he died early in the morning on Dec. 22, 2014, according to sources.Abduweli contracted the disease at a refugee detention center in Padang Besar, in Songkhla’s Sadao district, where he and 70 other Uyghurs had been held since March 2014 under cramped and unhygienic conditions, the sources said.Chalida Tajaroensuk, director of Thai civil society group People's Empowerment, told RFA’s Uyghur Service that she had been unable to visit the boy after he arrived at the hospital in late October because he was in critical condition.“The doctors tried to help him and did their best to take care of him,” she said.“He fell ill in detention and the tuberculosis [infection] went to his head, putting him in a serious condition.”Tajaroensuk said Abduweli’s disease was the first serious health problem to affect a child in the Padang Besar detention camp, but that the Thai government had done little to improve conditions there since.“It was the first instance in which a kid was hospitalized because of a serious condition, but the Thai government didn’t say anything [about his sickness],” she said.“Even though he was not a Thai citizen, he was a citizen of the world and he had the right to life.”In addition to the 70 detainees in Padang Besar, more than 300 Turkic-speaking Uyghurs are being held in Thailand after fleeing Xinjiang, where an upsurge in violence, which China has blamed on terrorists and Islamist insurgents seeking to establish an independent state, has left hundreds dead since 2012.Uyghur exiles and rights groups, however, have criticized Chinese authorities’ heavy-handed rule in the region—including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people—which they say has forced many to flee overseas, often through Southeast Asia.‘Conditions were horrible’
