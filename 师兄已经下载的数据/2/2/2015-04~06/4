Chinese Hackers Circumvent Popular Web Privacy Tools | NDTV Gadgets360.com
Chinese hackers have found a way around widely used privacy technology 
to target the creators and readers of Web content that state censors 
have deemed hostile, according to new research.
The hackers were able 
to circumvent two of the most trusted privacy tools on the Internet: 
virtual private networks, or VPNs, and Tor, the anonymity software that 
masks a computer's true whereabouts by routing its Internet connection 
through various points around the globe, according to findings by Jaime 
Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault, a Silicon Valley security 
company.
Both tools are used by Chinese businesses and by millions
 of citizens to bypass China's censorship technology, often called the 
Great Firewall, and to make their Web activities unreadable to state 
snoopers.
The attackers compromised websites frequented by Chinese
 journalists as well as China's Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, Blasco 
discovered last week.
As long as visitors to those websites were 
also logged into one of 15 Chinese Internet portals - including those 
run by Baidu, Alibaba and RenRen - the hackers were able to steal names,
 addresses, sex, birth dates, email addresses, phone numbers and even 
the Internet cookies that track other websites viewed by a user.
To
 get around the Tor and VPN technology, the attackers relied on a server
 software vulnerability that China's top companies apparently didn't 
patch, Blasco said.
While Blasco and others have not been able to 
pinpoint the identity of the hackers, the list of targets and the 
sophistication of the attacks suggest they may have been directed by the
 Chinese government.
"Who else could be potentially interested in 
this information and go to such lengths? Who else would want to know who
 was visiting Uighur websites and reporters' websites inside China?" 
Blasco said in interview. "There's no financial gain from targeting 
these sites."
Since taking power in late 2012, President Xi 
Jinping has shown a personal interest in how the Internet is managed, by
 creating and leading a committee responsible for Internet governance.
He
 has also given broad powers to the newly formed Cyberspace 
Administration of China, which has in turn targeted Internet celebrities
 who influence online opinion, increased blocks on foreign websites and 
sought to project China's influence over the Internet internationally.
In
 the past few months, the Chinese government has blocked sales and 
disabled the protocols of VPNs. It also hijacked Internet traffic 
flowing to Baidu, China's biggest Internet company, using it to 
overwhelm and knock down websites like GitHub that carry content China's
 sensors deem hostile, including content from The New York Times.
Activists
 and security experts advised Chinese Internet users to protect 
themselves from state-sponsored surveillance by using Tor and VPNs, and 
foreigners inside China have long done so. But Blasco's discovery 
suggests that Beijing's Internet censors have found a way to render 
those tools useless.
"There's a growing sense within China that 
widely used VPN services that were once considered untouchable are now 
being touched," said Nathan Freitas, a fellow at the Berkman Center for 
Internet and Society at Harvard and technical adviser to the Tibet 
Action Institute.
The Cyberspace Administration of China did not return requests for comment.
Blasco
 said the Uighur and press-related sites had been compromised with a 
"watering hole attack" in which attackers find a way to hide malicious 
code in websites frequented by their targets and then wait for their 
victims to come to them. Once people visit those sites, that code gets 
injected into their Web browsers.
The technique has been used by governments and hackers for surveillance and to steal passwords.
What
 made the attacks particularly serious, Blasco said, was that as long as
 the victims were logged into China's 15 top Web services - including 
major portals like Baidu, Taobao, QQ, Sina, Sohu, Ctrip and RenRen - the
 attackers could identify them and siphon off their personal digital 
information, even if their victims were logged into Tor or a VPN.
They did this with the aid of a particularly serious vulnerability that the 15 Web services in China apparently never patched.
The
 vulnerability, known as JSONP, is not new. It was publicized in a 
Chinese security and Web forum around 2013, about the same time forensic
 evidence suggests attackers used it to target Muslim Uighur websites 
and nongovernmental organizations' sites, Blasco said.
By not 
patching this hole, Blasco said, major Web portals like Baidu and 
Taobao, a subsidiary of Alibaba, effectively neutered the only privacy 
protections available to Web users inside China.
"The equivalent 
would be if law enforcement was able to exploit a serious vulnerability 
in Facebook to deanonymize users of Tor and VPNs in the United States," 
Blasco said. "You would assume Facebook would fix that pretty fast."
It
 is not clear, given the severity of the vulnerability and its discovery
 some two years ago, why so many of China's top Web portals did not fix 
it.
A Baidu spokesman said the company did try to deal with the problem.
"To
 the best of our knowledge, our earlier efforts were successful in 
preventing any serious leak of personal use data. But in light of this 
further information, we have decided to implement a more aggressive and 
thorough fix across Baidu for the JSONP vulnerability," the spokesman 
said.
A spokesman for Alibaba also said the company was now moving
 to deal with the problem. "Alibaba Group takes data security seriously 
and we do everything possible to protect our users," said Robert 
Christie, vice president of international media at Alibaba.
"Many 
companies in our space have faced this issue, and once we discovered 
this issue, we moved swiftly to address it. We have found no evidence 
that any user information has been compromised," he said.
Researchers
 say the complexity of the attack and the lack of digital fingerprints 
indicate that someone with significant influence had to have been 
directing it. Otherwise, "there must be a cybercriminal out there with 
pretty significant access to China's Internet infrastructure," Freitas 
said.
