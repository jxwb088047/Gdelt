Private Firms In China Given Permission To Import Oil | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide
In line with its liberalization policy, Chinaâ€™s State Council has decided to allow private enterprises to import up to 30 million tons of crude oil a year.
The government will grant the oil-import franchise to around 10 firms this year, revealed Pang Guanglian, secretary general of the committee for international exchanges and foreign enterprises of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, according to Shanghai Securities News.
Initially, the franchisees will have to import oil through China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec, which currently monopolize oil imports, before being allowed to make direct imports later on.
The Ministry of Commerce already granted permission to Xinjiang-based Guanghui Energy to import 200,000 tons of crude oil in 2014.
Lin Boqiang, director of China Energy Economic Research Center at Xiamen University, confirmed oil-import liberalization, saying that it can meet the oil demands of municipal oil-refining enterprises, which are laden with over 10% idle capacity, due to an insufficient oil supply.
The liberalization can also spur oil-refining enterprises to upgrade their technological level and prompt them to seek mergers, according to Lin, adding that private franchisees will contribute to the securing of low-cost quality oil.
