Thousands of villagers help police hunt for Xinjiang terrorists[1]|chinadaily.com.cn
A screenshot from CCTV shows police and local farmers on horses tracking down the terrorists.
A video released on Monday showed more than 10,000 farmers teaming up with police to trace three terrorists hiding near Tianshan Mountain in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
In the clip released by State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), hoe-wielding farmers from four villages, some riding horses, march deep into the mountains with police.
According to the TV station, the farmers voluntarily joined the search, staged early this year after reports were received from residents that three terrorists might be hiding in the mountains.
As police narrowed down the search for the terrorists' hideout, one suspect sneaked out to go to a nearby village to escape hunger and cold weather. His presence was immediately spotted by locals.
Police identified the person as the leader of the gang and after 62 hours, all three terrorists were captured.
"I did not expect the whole town was looking for me, nor did I think nobody would give me shelter," one of the suspects captured in the hunt says in the video.
"I am firmly against terrorism and detest these violent criminals," a villager says.
Another farmer taking part in the action said they would no longer keep silent about terrorism. "People of all ethnic groups will fight them (the terrorists) together."
At least one policeman was killed during the mission, CCTV said.
