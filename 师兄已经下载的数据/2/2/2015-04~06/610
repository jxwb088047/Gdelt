Republican Fox News 'Expert Lies' About Future Of Iran Nuclear Deal
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 3, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the reactions from various leaders to the new Iran Nuclear Deal.
Everyone seems to have something to say about the new Iran Nuclear deal that will see the Iranian government avoiding stockpiling materials that can be used to create nuclear weapons in exchange for the removal of sanctions against the middle eastern country. U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry were mostly positive, promising that the Iranians would have to be transparent in their dealings for the plan to work. Others, such as Israeli cabinet minister for intelligence Yuval Steinitz have claimed that there is no way the Iranians will hold up their end of the deal and that they were still a threat to peace in the region. The final draft of the deal is due on June 30th and Iran and the U.S. and its allies are expected to sign not soon after.”
