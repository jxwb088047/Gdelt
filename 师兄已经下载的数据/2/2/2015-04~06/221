Joe Biden to Authoritarian Chinese President: U.S. Only Supports Human Rights As Political
Vice President Joe Biden once told Chinese President Xi Jinping that U.S. leaders only support human rights as a matter of political optics, and that this makes the United States no better than China, according to a new New Yorker profile of Jinping.
The New Yorker relates encounters between Biden and Jinping in 2011 and 2012, when both were vice presidents of their respective nations:
Biden told me that Xi asked him why the U.S. put so much emphasis on human rights. Biden replied to Xi, No President of the United States could represent the United States were he not committed to human rights, and went on, If you dont understand this, you cant deal with us. President Barack Obama would not be able to stay in power if he did not speak of it. So look at it as a political imperative. It doesnt make us better or worse. Its who we are. You make your decisions. Well make ours.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board noted that Jinping has severely punished political dissent, becoming Chinas most authoritarian leader since Mao Zedong:
Mr. Xi took the advice. Since taking office he has detained more than 1,000 political prisoners, from anticorruption activist Xu Zhiyong to lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and journalist Gao Yu. He has cracked down on Uighurs in Xinjiang, banning more Muslim practices and jailing scholar-activist Ilham Tohti for life. Anti-Christian repression and Internet controls are tightening. Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo remains in prison, his wife Liu Xia under illegal house arrest for the fifth year. Lawyer Gao Zhisheng left prison in August but is blocked from receiving medical care overseas. Hong Kong, Chinas most liberal city, is losing its press freedom and political autonomy.
Let me know if you would like to be on or off the ping list
Obviously. Its the same reason democrats (or politicians generally) support civil rights, or gender equality, or homosexual rights, etc at home. Political expediency.
If you aren’t part of the ruling class you have no human rights.
The right of free politcal speech, the right to self defense against an oppressive government and violence, the right for a fair trial and due process....
for Obama it is so - here we have a devoted Marxist/Socialist campaigning as a moderate democrat, talking as one, but once firmly empowered reveals his natural belief’s by ruling as a Marxist/socialist - a wolf is sheep’s clothing!
IOW, Democrats don’t give a rat’s arse about Human Rights..............
Jinkping - - Joe Biden speaks for Democrats - and he's probably right on them... Democrats brought this country slavery, Jim Crow, Benghazi, floods of illegals (for political power), credible rape charges, treaties from hell, etc...
What Jinkping MUST understand is Joe Biden doesn't speak for all Americans... Biden speaks for SOME Americans - he speaks for the criminal element, illegals, dependent women, blacks, union bosses, and white liberal elites.
We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, for political optics....
Always knew this about DemonRats. They exploit “the struggle”, no matter how it is cast.
In other words, leftists are only pretending to care about human rights.
“We’ll be in a better position to make concessions after the election.”
You wonder what other optics are justification for pure lies.
