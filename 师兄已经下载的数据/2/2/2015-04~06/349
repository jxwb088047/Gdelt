Israeli Soldiers Interviewed: Told To Shoot To Kill... Everyone
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMay 7, 2015Leave a Comment
There’s a group in Israel called “Breaking The Silence,” what they do is interview different soldiers and officers in the Israeli Defense Forces after an operation to try to determine what happened and if they followed the rules of war. During their interview of 100 IDF soldiers who were involved in Operation Protective Edge the group learned that the IDF forces were told explicitly to shoot to kill, even if it they killed civilians. Cenk Uygur (https://twitter.com/cenkuygur) discusses on The Young Turks. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The Israeli military deliberately pounded civilian areas in the Gaza Strip with incessant fire of inaccurate ordinance during last year’s war against Hamas and was at best indifferent about casualties among the Palestinian population.
Those are the conclusions of a report complied by Breaking the Silence, an Israeli group that has spent the eight months since the end of the war, known as Operation Protective Edge, interviewing more than 60 members of the Israeli army, air force and navy, including soldiers and officers up to the rank of major.
The service personnel paint a picture that runs counter to official Israeli military claims that the surgical operation – which became a full-blown conflict after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and murdered in the occupied West Bank – took great care to avoid civilian casualties and that Gaza’s already fragile infrastructure was not unnecessarily targeted.”*
