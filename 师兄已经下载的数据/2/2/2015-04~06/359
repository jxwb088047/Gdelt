147 Dead After Al-Shabab Attack On Kenya University
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 2, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the Shabab attack on a Kenya university that left one hundred and forty-seven dead.
Shabab gunmen attacked the Garissa University College in northeastern Kenya taking hostages and killing non-Muslims. Witnesses reported seeing the gunmen in combat gear with some wearing bullet proof vests or suicide vests. A firefight with Kenyan security forces killed the gunmen but when the smoke cleared the body count stood at 147.
The Shabab is an extremist group from Somalia with close ties to Al Qaeda. It claimed that it had started the attack as an ‘operation against the infidels’.”
