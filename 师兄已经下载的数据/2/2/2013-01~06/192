Military exercise in East Turkistan after clashes | Asia-Pacific | Worldbulletin News
China staged a large military exercise in the ethnically-divided in East Turkistan, (aka Uyghur Autonomous Region of China) on Saturday. 
Tanks, military vehicles, and armed personnel blocked access to streets in in East Turkistan's capital Urumqi, where at least 1,000 personnel carried out the exercise. 
The exercise came ahead of the fourth anniversary on July 5 of riots in Urumqi between members of China's mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority and its Han majority, which left around 200 dead.
Saturday's exercise -- which began this afternoon and was expected to last around five hours -- was carried out by members of the People's Armed Police, part of China's armed forces responsible for law enforcement and internal security during peacetime.
China's state-run media on Saturday blamed over 100 people it branded "terrorists" for sparking "riots" in East Turkistan, the previous day.
The recent events in Lemchin unfolded when Muslim Turkic people in East Turkistan protested against having their lands seized and police responded with violence. Last month farmers living in the Gulja region built shed in their fields from which to keep constant patrol so as not to have their land seized.
In the recent incident, farmers whose lands had been confiscated complained to local administrators, but no results were produced. After this the people of the region went to Urumqi and Beijing to appeal to the Chinese National People's Congress and judicial organs.
However, they farmers were told that they had to handle the issue before the local authorities who had turned them away, and were forcibly sent back to their homeland under police custody.
The people of Turfan county Pichan village Lemchin Gungshe whose lands had been forcibly taken from them gathered after the morning prayer on Tuesday June 26, and went to the Lemchin City Police Station to ask for the return of the lands which had been given to the Chinese immigrants. The arguments which ensued turned into a clash.
