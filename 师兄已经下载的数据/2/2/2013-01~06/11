Staged military exercise in China's Xinjiang after riot, Asia News & Top Stories - The Straits Times
URUMQI, China (AFP) - China staged a large military exercise in the ethnically-divided Xinjiang region on Saturday, an Agence France-Presse reporter said, where clashes this week killed at least 35 people.
Tanks, army vehicles, and army personnel blocked access to streets in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi, where army units carried out an exercise, an AFP reporter present at the scene said. Large sections of the city's centre were shut down for the exercise, she said.
