 "Knife-wielding mobs" launched the attacks around 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Tuesday) in Xinjiang's Lukqun Township near the oasis town of Turpan, Xinhua quoted local officials as saying.

 Assailants "stabbed at people and set fire to police cars," the agency quoted regional officials from China's ruling Communist Party as saying.

 At least 17 people were killed, "before police opened fire and shot dead 10 rioters", the officials said.

 The dead included nine policemen or security guards and eight civilians, while local hospitals were treating three injured people, the agency said.

 It said police detained three suspects and were searching for an unknown number of others who fled.

 The report did not give details of the attackers, but similar incidents in Xinjiang have been blamed on members of the region's Uighur minority.

 The report came after 21 people died in violence in the region in April.
