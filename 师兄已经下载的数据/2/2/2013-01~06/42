China Reports More Unrest In Xinjiang Region
Chinese media have reported more violence in the ethnically divided western region of Xinjiang.
The state-run "Global Times" reported on June 29 that more than 100 people, riding motorbikes and wielding knifes, attempted on June 28 to invade a police station in the Hotan region, an area heavily populated by ethnic Uyghur Muslims.
No details were available on any casualties from what the report described as a "terrorist" attack.
Earlier this week, authorities said unrest in Xinjiang had killed 35 people.
A series of violent incidents has been reported in Xinjiang in the run-up to the fourth anniversary of the July 5, 2009, riots in the region that killed around 200 people.
Uyghurs accuse Chinese authorities of seeking to marginalize them by supporting the migration of millions of Han Chinese to their territory.
