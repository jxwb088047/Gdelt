BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government will steadfastly safeguard the security of people after violent terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, the CPC's flagship newspaper People's Daily said in a Sunday commentary.
The atrocity of terrorists in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region outraged the entire nation. Though the attacks took place in Xinjiang, they should not be regarded as an ethnic or religion issue, but a typical terrorism act, the commentator's article said.
Xinjiang in northwest China was hit by violent terrorist attacks in the past few days, in which at least 24 innocent civilians and police officers were killed.
The terrorists attacked innocent civilians and police officers regardless of laws and people's lives, and should be severely cracked down on, the article said.
Terrorism is the enemy of the Chinese of all ethnic groups, and no government in the world would tolerate such violent attacks, it added.
The commentary said that the violent attacks have become an overt provocation to the security of people's lives and the country's unity and threats to people's fundamental interests, as well as the stability in Xinjiang.
Only severe crackdowns on the terrorists will lead to social stability and harmony, it said.
On Friday, President Xi Jinping presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to arrange the work of safeguarding social stability in Xinjiang and the interests of people of all ethnic groups.
Yu Zhengsheng, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, went to Xinjiang on Saturday to oversee the work of safeguarding social stability.
In recent years, Xinjiang has achieved sound development in economy and great improvement in people's livelihood. But separatists in and outside the country have been escalating their efforts, posing danger to local people.
The commentary called on cadres at all levels to be mindful of potential dangers and keep high level of responsibility to maintain social stability and secure people's lives.
