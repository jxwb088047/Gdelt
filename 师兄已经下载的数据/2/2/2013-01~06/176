New Violence Reported In China's Xinjiang Region
China's state media has reported fresh violence in China's restive far western region of Xinjiang.
The reports said a "violent attack" took place on June 28 in the city of Hotan but gave no details.
Earlier this week, at least 35 people were killed in clashes between residents and police and other violent incidents in the region.
Xinjiang, a sprawling region that borders Central Asia, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Russia, is home to some 10 million mostly Uyghur Muslims.
Uyghurs complain of tight restrictions on religious and cultural life by Beijing and say the authorities are marginalizing them by policies favoring Han Chinese migrants.
The government says it faces an organized terrorist threat from Muslim groups in the region.
In July 2009, nearly 200 people were killed in riots in Xinjiang's regional capital of Urumqi.
