China calls Xinjiang unrest a 'terrorist attack', ups death toll to 35 - bdnews24.com
Xinjiang is home to a large Muslim Uighur community and violence 
focusing on its discontent had been confined recently to southern districts. The 
altercations in Shanshan county on Wednesday marked a return of unrest to 
Xinjiang's north.Many Uighurs, Muslims who speak a Turkic language, 
chafe at what they call Chinese government restrictions on their culture, 
language and religion. China says it grants Uighurs wide-ranging freedoms and 
accuses extremists of separatism.On Wednesday, gangs with knives 
attacked a police station and a government building and set fire to police cars. 
Twenty-four people died in clashes with police, including 16 Uighurs, state news 
agency Xinhua said.According to Xinhua's latest dispatch on Thursday 
night, eight more died in the police response. It called the incident a "violent 
terrorist attack" and said the overall situation was now "on the whole, 
stable".An officer at Shanshan county's public security, or police, 
bureau told Reuters by telephone that the cause of the riots and the ethnic 
origin of the attackers remained unclear.Xinjiang government officials 
could not be reached.A resident of Shanshan, speaking by telephone, said 
police officers were patrolling town streets, though he was unable to say if 
their presence was heavier than usual.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua 
Chunying condemned the incident, though she stopped short of saying who was 
behind it."This is a violent terrorist surprise attack. There is no 
doubt about that," she said at a daily ministry briefing. "But with regard to 
who they are, or whether foreign forces were involved ... local public security 
is vigorously investigating."CLASH IN THE SOUTHA clash two 
months ago in Xinjiang's south, involving axes, knives and at least one gun, 
culminated in a house being burned down, with 21 people dead. The local 
government also described that incident as a "terrorist attack".Uighurs 
make up 88 percent of residents in Shanshan county, according to the Global 
Times, a tabloid owned by the Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's 
Daily.Dilxat Raxit, the Sweden-based spokesman for the exiled World 
Uyghur Congress, blamed the "continued suppression and provocation" in Xinjiang 
for the conflict.Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit 
said the latest deaths highlighted the failure of Chinese authorities to resolve 
the region's ethnic and religious tensions."The government needs to come 
up with a new approach to dealing with ethnic and religious strains in China's 
minority regions, as its past efforts to address them with tight security and 
economic development have been a manifest failure," Innes-Ker said in a 
statement.The Global Times renewed accusations by the authorities that 
"overseas terrorist forces" were to blame."Many foreign forces would 
like to see turbulence in Xinjiang, but those with a little analytical sense 
know this can hardly be reality," it said in an editorial.Wednesday's 
unrest was the deadliest in Xinjiang since July 2009, when nearly 200 people 
were killed in riots pitting Uighurs against ethnic Chinese in the region's 
capital Urumqi, about 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Shanshan.
