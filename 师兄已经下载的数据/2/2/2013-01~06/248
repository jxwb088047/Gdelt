Riots in China's Xinjiang kill 27: Xinhua - The China Post
Beijing has launched a stream of high-profile investment projects in an attempt to boost economic growth in the relatively poor region, which has rich reserves of coal and gas.
According to official figures, 46 percent of Xinjiang's population is Uyghur, while another 39 percent are Han Chinese, after millions from the majority group moved there in recent decades in search of jobs.
The Han settlement drive, which has been mirrored in Tibet, has fostered tensions with the existing community.
The Uyghurs, who mostly follow Sunni Islam, speak a Turkic language and have ethnic links with groups in neighboring countries including Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
Xinjiang's regional government was not available for comment on Wednesday's violence. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular briefing that she was aware of reports, without giving further information.
