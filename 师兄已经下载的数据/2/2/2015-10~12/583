US Embassy in China issues terror warning for Western citizens
Security has been heightened around a popular Beijing bar and shopping area frequented by foreigners, after the U.S. Embassy in Beijing issued a warning Thursday about possible threats against travelers during the holiday period.
French, British, Australian and Irish officials followed with similar alerts for their citizens living or visiting Beijing, generally considered one of the world's safest cities for foreigners.
Photos on social media showed a heightened police presence in front of a Sanlitun shopping center home to major worldwide brands. Last summer, a Chinese man with a Samurai sword stabbed and killed a Chinese woman walking in the area with her French husband.
A yellow alarm is the second lowest in China, and is often used during holidays - including the National Day in October - at crowded areas such as shopping malls. "The US Embassy has issued the same guidance to US government personnel", it added, without elaborating on the threats.
The American and British warnings, which were worded identically, singled out the Sanlitun neighbourhood in eastern Beijing, but they gave no details about the potential threat.
Dozens of extra police officers, some toting rifles, appeared on Christmas Eve on the streets of the popular Sanlitun section of the city.
NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports that authorities blanketed the Sanlitun embassy district in heavy security.
Beijing blames them on Islamist militants and separatists of Xinjiang Uyghur region who are trying to establish an independent state called East Turkestan.
The U.K. government has warned citizens of the violence in a travel advisory posted to its website.
Though China has been battling terrorists in Xinjiang and several parts of the country, it is rare to receive open threats.
