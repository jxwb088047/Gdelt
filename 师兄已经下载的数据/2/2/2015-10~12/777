In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiOctober 29, 2015Leave a Comment
Richland Country Sheriff Leon Lott reluctantly fired the officer responsible for slamming a student to the ground in class, but then went on to defend his use of force. Then came the victim-blaming. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The school resource officer who was caught on camera violently flipping a South Carolina high school student at her desk has been fired, authorities announced Wednesday.
Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said an internal investigation over the Monday incident at Spring Valley High School in Columbia focused on whether Senior Deputy Ben Fields had violated the department’s policies.
He said at a news conference that the department looked at cellphone videos taken from the classroom and interviews with witnesses, and concluded that the maneuvers he used in the confrontation were “not acceptable.””*
