Even many of those enthusiastic about bombing ISIS usually pay lip service to wanting to minimize civilian casualties. Not Donald Trump. He thinks civilian casualties are essential. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asserted on Wednesday that the only way to defeat ISIS was to kill their families.

“I like to do one thing at a time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade. “I would knock the hell out of ISIS.”

“What about civilian casualties?” Kilmeade wondered.

“One of the problems that we have and one of the reasons we’re so ineffective, they’re using them as shields,” Trump explained.

According to the GOP hopeful, President Barack Obama was waging “a very politically correct war.”

“With the terrorists, you have to take out their families,” Trump said. “When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.”

“They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. But they say they don’t care about them. You have to take out their families.”

We can’t let last night’s debate pass without focusing a little bit more on what would have been, in sane times, headline news for weeks: and that was that most of the candidates agree that we should target and kill the families of terrorists. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Donald Trump was the main event, as expected. He’s the frontrunner and he’s set the parameters for the debate with his various proposals over the course of the campaign to “do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.” He reiterated his call to kill the relatives of terrorists, at one point even petulantly bellowing “so they can kill us but we can’t kill them?” He also proved that he had no idea what the “nuclear triad” is and suggested that you can “shut down certain areas” of the internet, promising to get the best people to work on the problem. In other words, Trump was Trump, articulating every absurd impulse that passed through his mind.

It’s rather shocking when you think about it. On the stage were three sitting senators, one former and two current governors, all of whom had more knowledge and experience than Trump and it didn’t seem to matter. The entire event was an exercise in who could make a more bellicose pronouncement of martial aggression than Donald Trump. Not that they agreed on what should be done, mind you. They bickered among themselves about whether or not Assad had to go and whether we should put “boots on the ground”. Allegedly reasonable mainstream candid...
