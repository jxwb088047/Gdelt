Muslim High School Student Called ISIS Member
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiOctober 29, 20152 Comments
A high school student in New Jersey was wearing a headdress and another student took a picture of her in the cafeteria. He posted that photo on Snapchat and called it ISIS. Saira Ali tried fighting back, but the high school administrators don’t believe it is bullying. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Brett Erlich (Pop Trigger) hosts of The Young Turks discuss.
Is this bullying? What actions should be taken against the student who took the pic? Let us know in the comments below.
“Saira Ali is a 19-year-old high school student from Avenel, New Jersey. In June, a classmate of hers posted a video of her on Snapchat without her consent.
According to Ali, the classmate wrote “ISIS” on the video and then set it as his Snapchat story.
She wrote about the incident on her Facebook at the time.
“You might think there’s no hate crime where you live and before you know it, some ignorant kid from your school makes a video of you at lunch, closes up on your face, calls you ISIS, and then sets it as his snapchat story for everyone to see as if he’s not insulting billions of people,” she wrote. “Please excuse me while I teach this kid a lesson.”
Ali reported the video to the Woodbridge Township School District. The school investigated the incident, as did the local police.”
It is troubling when the people who run our educational system are the least educated of all. This is bullying. Couldn’t the girl identify the offending student? The school officials didn’t appear to try very hard – and they took four months not to do anything. If they had found the student, he wouldn’t need to be suspended, but he should have gotten a stern talking to. – and made to apologize.
The only real issue here is the behavior of the school. Lying to cover their asses isn’t a positive.
