Univision Democratic Debate
9pm ET (8pm CT, 7pm MT, 6pm PT)
Moderators: Karen Tumulty, Maria Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos


 Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face off for the second time in four days Wednesday night at Miami Dade College in Miami. The debate location gives the candidates a chance to appeal to Florida voters before the state offers up 246 delegates in its primary next week.

So far, Clinton is significantly ahead of Sanders in the delegate count, but the Vermont senator vows he will stay in the race until the convention, and his campaign has emphasized that it is ready for a long slog. Sanders scored a big symbolic win in Michigan Tuesday, just one day before the debate, but he effectively tied Clinton in delegates there and she took home a large win in Mississippi, putting her farther ahead in the count. The former secretary of state has scored big wins in Southern states with many black voters and large delegate counts, while Sanders has typically fared better in small, whiter states that hold caucuses.

Sanders has struggled to win over minority voters, often ceding those groups to Clinton by overwhelming margins. In Florida, Clinton holds a wide lead in state polling, but both candidates have been highlighting their support ...

Hillary Clinton - Bernie Sanders Town Hall Part 2 | MSNBC...
Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton ( /ˈhɪləri daɪˈæn ˈrɒdəm ˈklɪntən/; born October 26, 1947) is the 67th United States Secretary of State, serving in the administration of President Barack Obama. She was a United States Senator for New York from 2001 to 2009. As the wife of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, she was the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001. In the 2008 election, Clinton was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
A native of Illinois, Hillary Rodham first attracted national attention in 1969 for her remarks as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley College. She embarked on a career in law after graduating from Yale Law School in 1973. Following a stint as a Congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas in 1974 and married Bill Clinton in 1975. Rodham cofounded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families in 1977 and became the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978. Named the first female partner at Rose Law Firm in 1979, she was twice listed as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America. First Lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992 with husband Bill as Governor, she successfully led a task force to reform Arkansas's education system. She sat on the board of directors of Wal-Mart Stores and several other corporations.
