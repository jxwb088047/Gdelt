Chinese President Xi Jinping also sent a condolence message to French President Francois Hollande and assured him that China would work with France and the global community to “enhance cooperation in security, fight terrorism and ensure safety of people in all countries”.

The East Turkestan Islamic MoveÂ­ment (Etim) is credited with promoting terrorism in China, contributing to the deadly attacks in the country.

“Double standards shouldn’t be allowed,” he said, alluding to the view of some Western countries that violence by separatists in China is not considered acts of terrorism.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said Etim poses threats not only to China, but also to the global community, hence “double standards should be abandoned” and all sides should “form a united front against terrorism”.
While there have been suggestions by experts that Etim is largely defunct, Hong said China has sufficient evidence on the group’s danger to the international community.
