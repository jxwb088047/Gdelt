CAIR Asks Donald Trump to Apologize to Muslim Woman Abused by Crowd, Kicked Out of Rally

(WASHINGTON, D.C., 1/8/16) - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to offer a public apology to a Muslim woman verbally abused by the crowd and kicked out of one of his campaign rallies tonight in South Carolina.

“The image of a Muslim woman being abused and ejected from a political rally sends a chilling message to American Muslims and to all those who value our nation’s traditions of religious diversity and civic participation,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. “Donald Trump should issue a public apology to the Muslim woman kicked out of his rally and make a clear statement that American Muslims are welcome as fellow citizens and as participants in the nation’s political process.”

Awad also called on Trump to meet with American Muslim leaders to help stem the anti-Muslim hysteria resulting from his rhetoric and that of other GOP presidential candidates.

Last month, CAIR joined other national American Muslim organizations in condemning a Trump policy statement “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Donald Trump is doubling down on his proposed policy of registering all muslims nationwide. He doesn’t seem worried about the concerns of some media and other politicians that this sounds eerily similar to Nazi rhetoric. Ana Kasparian (The Point), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Donald J. Trump drew back Friday from calling for a national database to keep track of Muslims in America, saying that the suggestion had come from a reporter.

Mr. Trump caused a stir Thursday night when he was asked by an NBC reporter if all Muslims should have to register with the federal government and replied: “They have to be.”

When pressed on how such a database would work, he said that people would have to sign up in different places and that it would be an issue of management.

On Friday, he took to Twitter to distance himself from the idea.

\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been spouting increasingly fascist ideas for months, but in an interview published today by Yahoo he crossed what must be some kind of rubicon toward actual Nazism and not just the implication of it. When asked by Yahoo whether he\'d track Muslims in the US by \"registering [them] in a database or giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion,\" Trump didn\'t rule those obviously insane ideas out. \"We\'re going to have to — we\'re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,\" Trump told Yahoo. \"We\'re going to have to look at the mosques. We\'re going to have to look very, very carefully.””*

A Short Bio on Rand Paul
Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Dr. Paul has proven to be an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Rand has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope.

A devoted husband and father, Dr. Paul and his family live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Rand owned his own ophthalmology practice and performed eye surgery for 18 years. As a hard-working and dedicated physician--not a career politician--Rand Paul came to Washington to shake things up and to make a difference.

Dr. Paul has been married for 24 years to Kelley Ashby Paul of Russellville, Kentucky, and together, they have three sons: William, 21; Duncan, 18; and Robert, 15.

Donald John Trump, Sr. (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, television personality and author. He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts. Trump's extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No. 17 on the 2011 Forbes Celebrity 100 list. He is well-known as a real-estate developer who amassed vast hotel, casino, and other real-estate properties, in the New York City area and around the world.
Trump is the son of Fred Trump, a wealthy New York City real-estate developer. He worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1968 officially joined the company. He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization.
In 2010, Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In May 2011, he announced he would not be a candidate, but a few weeks later he said he had not completely ruled out the possibility. In December 2011, Trump was suggested as a possible Vice Presidential selection by Michele Bachmann. Bachmann has since suspended her presidential campaign.
