Rush Limbaugh Chooses Sides In Trump Vs. Ted Cruz Battle - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Chris HouckDecember 16, 2015Leave a Comment
“Both Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh have been cheerleaders for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, declining to condemn outright his proposed ban on Muslims immigrating to the United States.
But both on Monday bashed the real estate mogul for attacking Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and calling the senator a “maniac” who cannot work with his Senate colleagues.
Limbaugh described Trump’s negative comments about Trump as a “huge mistake” during his radio show on Monday.
“A genuine conservative, even in the Republican field, would not go after Cruz this way. So that just raised a red flag for me, made me somewhat curious,” Limbaugh said.
In a Monday Facebook post, Levin said that Trump’s description of Cruz as a “maniac” suggests that the real estate mogul believes that “all conservatives who support Cruz against McConnell” are maniacs.”*
