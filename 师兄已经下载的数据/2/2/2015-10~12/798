China has been cracking down on what it calls "terrorists with foreign links" in Xinjiang
China has effectively expelled a French journalist over an article she wrote that was critical of Beijing’s policy towards Muslim Uighers in Xinjiang.
Beijing confirmed it would not renew press credentials for Ursula Gauthier, of the French news magazine L’Obs.
It said an article she wrote about the unrest in Xinjiang supported “terrorism and cruel acts” that had killed people.
Ms Gauthier called the claims “absurd” and said Beijing was trying to deter foreign reporters in the country.
If her press card is not renewed, Ms Gauthier cannot apply for a new visa, and will have to leave China by 31 December.
She would be the first foreign journalist to be expelled since al-Jazeera correspondent Melissa Chan in 2012.
