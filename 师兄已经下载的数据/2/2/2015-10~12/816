Read Trump’s Lips: No New Muslims - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Chris HouckDecember 9, 2015Leave a Comment
Since Donald Trump has gone over the top and said he would ban all muslims from entering the country (including returning citizens and veterans), people have begun calling him out on it. Various outlets made Hitler comparisons. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Donald J. Trump called on Monday for the United States to bar all Muslims from entering the country until the nation’s leaders can “figure out what is going on” after the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric aimed at voters’ fears about members of the Islamic faith.
A prohibition of Muslims – an unprecedented proposal by a leading American presidential candidate, and an idea more typically associated with hate groups – reflects a progression of mistrust that is rooted in ideology as much as politics.
Mr. Trump, who in September declared “I love the Muslims,” turned sharply against them after the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for a database to track Muslims in America and repeating discredited rumors that thousands of Muslims celebrated in New Jersey on 9/11. His poll numbers rose largely as a result, until a setback in Iowa on Monday morning. Hours later Mr. Trump called for the ban, fitting his pattern of making stunning comments when his lead in the Republican presidential field appears in jeopardy.”*
