Item from Dec 29, 1983, in China Daily: Working at pump station No 9 in the Karamay Oilfield, some 3,000 kilometers to the west of Beijing in the border region of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is this model working team consisting of five ethnic groups - Uygur, Han, Hui, Mongolian and Kazak. The oilfield, located on the edge of the Gobi Desert, has taken on a new face in the past four years as blocks of new houses spring up one after another in this "boom town".
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the discovery of Karamay's oilfields in the northern part of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
The Karamay oilfields began supplying oil and natural gas on Oct 29, 1955. The previously remote area has since become a modern city boasting a population of about 450,000.
More than 30 oilfields have been discovered in the area in the past six decades, with about 2.6 billion metric tons of oil reserves detected, according to the local government. In 2002, crude oil output exceeded 10 million tons.
In 2012, Karamay launched a joint program with technology giant IBM to become a "smart city" to raise its quality of life and improve local administration. The concept is based on the latest urban concepts and technologies - such as the Internet of Things and cloud computing - that embrace and connect various sectors including transport, healthcare and public security.
Karamay is the first "wireless communications city" in northwestern China, paving the way for its digital aspirations, according to China Mobile, the nation's largest mobile operator by user base.
