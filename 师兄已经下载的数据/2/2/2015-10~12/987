There are 199 journalists in jail around the world
Freedom of the press is under threat in a lot of countries around the world. According to a new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are 199 journalists imprisoned right now.
China is the worst country for journalists: 49 are in prison there, a record number. China has actually even imprisoned three people just because their brother is a reporter in the U.S., who reports on the way China treats its Uighur minority.
Egypt has gotten a lot worse--they're now the second-worst place in the world for journalists, with 23 people in prison. And the number of journalists in jail in Turkey has doubled over the past year, to 14. And Eritrea, where 17 journalists are in jail, has never even charged any of them with a crime, meaning they've never had a chance to defend themselves in court.
