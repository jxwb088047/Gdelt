The FBI investigation of Syed Farook, Tashfeen Malik, and their neighbor Enrique Marquez--the alleged San Bernardino terrorists, as well as the LAUSD school closure following a terror threat that was later deemed as not credible is examined with retired FBI agent Jim Fitzgerald. The guns, social media, and the family around the shooters are explored deeper with attention to the case being built by the FBI. We also get the latest on the hot car death trial of Justin Harris, who is on trial for the death of his child that he left in a car while he worked and sexted, as well as the faked suicide by poisoning of Stacey Caster is looked at in this uncensored Crime Time, hosted by Allison Hope Weiner.

GUEST BIO:
James R. Fitzgerald was the Program Manager of Threat Assessment/Forensic Linguistics at the Behavioral Analysis Unit 1 of the FBI. Fitzgerald knew little about profiling or linguistics when he joined the FBI in 1987. But, while assigned to the field office in New York City, he worked cases involving stalking or threatening letters sent to Jane Pauley, Bryant Gumbel, Don Imus, Donald Trump, and Rush Limbaugh, among others.
In 1995, Fitzgerald became a profiler at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Va. As part of Fitzgerald’s profiler training, he learned about analyzing communications. He later obtained a Master’s degree in linguistics from Georgetown University. (This was his second MS. His first was in Organizational Psychology at Villanova University.) As he has at his present company, The Academy Group, Fitzgerald created a linguistic-oriented database of threatening and/o...

SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA — Federal investigators raided the Riverside, California home of Enrique Marquez — a former neighbor of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook — Saturday on allegations he purchased the two assault rifles used in Wednesday’s massacre, the Washington Post reported. 

Marquez allegedly bought the rifles three years ago. He checked himself into a mental-health facility after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal cited a law enforcement official as saying.

According to KABC, officials approached Marquez’s home with guns drawn and used a cutting torch and broke windows to get inside.

One of the guns was modified to hold a larger magazine, according to the Wall Street Journal. There had been an attempt to modify to fire on automatic, though this modification had failed, 89.3 KPCC reported.

According to 89.3 KPCC, Farook had purchased the handguns himself, while the assault rifles were allegedly purchased by Marquez in 2012. Marquez hasn’t been charged for any crime, according to the Wall Street Journal.
