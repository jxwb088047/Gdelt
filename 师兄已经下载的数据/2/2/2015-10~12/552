Elizabeth Warren gave a powerful speech calling for compassion for Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS. She criticized Republican fear mongering on the issue. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The U.S. can either lead by example or turn its back on human suffering, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in an impassioned 12-minute address on the Senate floor Tuesday.
Speaking in response to the calls to turn Syrian refugees away from the U.S. following the bombings and attacks last week that left a combined 172 people dead in Beirut and Paris, Warren argued that the country now faces a stark moral choice.
“These events test us,” Warren said. “It is easy to proclaim that we are tough and brave and good-hearted when threats feel far away — but when those threats loom large and close by, our actions will strip away our tough talk and reveal who we really are.””*
