China adopted its first counterterrorism law Sunday after early drafts of the bill attracted strong criticism for provisions that may tighten media controls and threaten the intellectual property of foreign firms.Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority group, has been plagued by unrest in recent years, prompting China to launch a police crackdown on separatist "terrorists" it says are behind the violence.The bill comes as Beijing silences critics of its Xinjiang policies, especially those who say violence by Uighurs is a reaction to government discrimination and controls over their culture and religion.One of these suggested that the government was partly to blame for rising inter-ethnic violence.
