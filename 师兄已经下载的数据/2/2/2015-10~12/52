Jonathan Miller is a City Councilman from Prairie View, TX. The same town Sandra Bland died in. He was recently tased by police at his own home, while he was kneeling. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"One witnesses said Miller was tased while he was on his knees with his hands at his side.

The encounter began when police stopped to question several of Miller\'s fraternity brothers gathered outside his house Thursday. When Miller attempted to intervene, police ordered him to step back, then tased and arrested him for reportedly interfering with police duties and resisting arrest.

As the confrontation escalated, one of the officers\' body cameras fell off. But the zap of the taser and Miller\'s pained scream were captured. Police released images from a second officer\'s body camera showing the end of the encounter.

The incident has drawn national attention, coming only three months after the July arrest of Sandra Bland.”*

A newly elected Texas city councilman is tasered and arrested outside his home. Jonathan Miller said his fraternity brothers were practicing a step dance routine when a police officer stopped to investigate. Miller says he identified himself as the resident of the home but the police continued their questioning. Prairie View, a suburb of Houston, was also the location of Sandra Bland’s arrest in July in a conflict that began over a minor traffic violation.

An investigation into police use of a Taser stun gun on a councilman in the Texas city where Sandra Bland was arrested has been turned over to the district attorney, officials said Monday. The Prairie View councilman, Jonathan Miller, was hit with a stun gun and arrested Thursday outside of his home. Police said one of the two officers involved in the confrontation was also involved in the July arrest of Bland, the black woman who died in her jail cell three days after she was pulled over. The district attorney\'s investigation and an internal Prairie View Police Department review will be conducted in part to determine \"if there\'s any training that our officers can benefit from,\" Prairie View Chief of Police Larry Johnson said at a news conference Monday.

Prairie View, Texas, has once again found itself the center of unwanted attention as officials try to get to the bottom of why Prairie View City Councilman Jonathan Miller was Tasered by police last week. The incident comes just a few months after 28-year-old Sandra Bland was arrested in Prairie View and died of an apparent hanging while in police custody. The Prairie View city council was due to meet with its police chief on Thursday, but that meeting was unexpectedly canceled late Wednesday night. The incident in question occurred last week outside of Miller\'s apartment. Police were confronting a trio of men, all alum of Prairie View A&M and fraternity brothers who were in town for the school\'s homecoming weekend and had helped Miller in an organized clean-up. In a police body cam video released by the Prairie View Police Department, an officer told the men they were responding to complaints by neighbors of \"drug activity.\"

**** Prairie View, Texas - A Prairie View city councilman was stunned and arrested by police in front of his home, and part of the incident was captured on video.

According to Prairie View police, officers approached four men and questioned them about recent disturbances or suspicious activity in the area.

While police were questioning the men, Councilman Jonathan Miller, 26, interrupted the investigation, police said.

Miller knew the men being questioned, and many were guests at his home, according to a witness.

At least two witnesses of the arrest told Channel 2 Investigates they believed the police officer who deployed his Taser, used ye.

\"As soon as they started pushing, I pulled out my camera, because if there\'s a camera the officer can\'t say my battery on my body cam went out or anything like that,\" Brandon Woodson said.

Woodson recorded part of the incident on his cellphone.

The clip Woodson forwarded to Channel 2 appeared to show a man being given commands and then falling forward, presumably after the Taser was deployed.

Police also recorded the incident with both body cameras and dash cameras.

Texas councilman tasered outside home Jonathan Miller Prairie View, Texas tasered arrested by Cops A Texas city councilman was stunned with a Taser while on his knees and then arrested outside his Prairie View home Thursday night — by police from the same department responsible for the arrest of Sandra Bland, who was found dead in her jail cell this summer.

The arrest involved a Prairie View cop – one of the city\'s six-officer force – with ties to Bland\'s arrest alongside Texas Department of Public Safety in July, authorities confirmed.

Newly-elected Councilman Jonathan Miller identified himself as an elected official while stepping between Prairie View cops confronting four of his fraternity brothers practicing a step routine, local reports said.

The 29-year-old’s credentials, which includes a vote to rename a street in Bland\'s honor, didn’t prevent what Miller’s friend described as another example of excessive force in the Houston suburb.

“It went from me asking questions to me basically being put face down on the ground,” Miller told KHOU-TV. Prairie View, Texas, councilman Jonathan Miller was stunned by a Taser outside his home while confronting police questioning his friends.

A Taser (often marketed as TASER) is a brand name and registered trademark of Taser International. The word most often refers to an electroshock weapon marketed by that company which uses electrical current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. The device functions by affecting "neuromuscular incapacitation" and the devices' mechanism "Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology". Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons. At the present time, there are two main police models, the M26 and X26. Both come with various accessories, including a laser sight and optional mounted digital video camera that can record in low-light situations. Taser International is also marketing a civilian model called the C2. On 27 July 2009, Taser introduced the X3, capable of firing three times without reload.
