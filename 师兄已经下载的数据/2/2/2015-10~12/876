Turkey shot down a Russian war plane today. Turkey claims the plane was violating its airspace. Putin has called the attack a stab in the back. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Turkey on Tuesday of directly supporting the so-called Islamic State after Turkish forces shot down one of Russia’s fighter jets near Syria’s border.
“Our military men are fighting terrorism, sacrificing their own lives, but today’s loss is a stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorism,” Putin said of Turkey, alleging that Ankara directly finances terrorism through illicit oil sales.
A Russian marine was killed during a search-and-rescue mission for the pilots of the downed jet, Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a briefing Tuesday. One of the helicopters being used to carry out the mission was fired on and had to make an emergency landing.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian rebel fighters brought down the Russian helicopter with a missile.
The Defense Ministry also announced that Russia is severing all military contracts with Turkey.
Russia maintains that its fighter jet stayed within Syrian airspace and did not endanger Turkish sovereignty, but Turkey has given a starkly different account of the incident.”*
