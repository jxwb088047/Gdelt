Two weeks after its first known execution of a Chinese hostage, extremist group Islamic State has published a war chant in Mandarin that calls on the country’s Muslims – or at least its Muslim men — to take up arms.
The four-minute song was released Al-Hayat Media Center, Islamic State’s media arm, and distributed through Twitter and messaging app Telegram on Sunday, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors and tracks radical groups online. Like many of the group’s chants, known as nasheeds, the track is slickly produced and hypnotically infectious, with lyrics that extol death in service of Islam.
“We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us,” a male voice, enhanced with a digital echo, sings in the chorus.  “Our dream is to die fighting on this battlefield.”
Recruitment efforts by Middle East jihadist groups are an increasing cause for concern in the world’s most populous country, though it’s rare for such materials to appear in Mandarin. Most instead target members of China’s Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim Uighur minority. A sporadically violent separatist movement made up of Uighurs seeks to establish an independent state in the group’s homeland in the northwestern Chinese territory of Xinjiang.
In June, Islamic State released a video of an elderly man describing in a Turkic language his decision to join the group after decades of oppression in China and the death of his son in Syria. The video later shows what appear to be Uighur children in military clothing being interviewed about traveling to join Islamic State.
The recording of a nasheed in Mandarin “is yet another example of the IS seeking to broaden its reach and support base,” SITE said.
China foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing on Monday that she was not aware of the song. “We hope we can safeguard the citizens of every country through international cooperation,” she added.
It’s not clear whom the group might be trying to reach. China’s Hui ethnic group – which is predominately Muslim and numbers more than 10 million – is Mandarin-speaking but has traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam. Mandarin is also the dominant language for some younger Uighurs.
China has been on guard against terrorism since knife-wielding extremists killed more than 30 at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming in 2014. On Monday, the website of the Communist Party-controlled China Youth Daily newspaper said police in central China’s Shanxi province had apprehended four members of a Uighur extremist group who were planning attacks in the area. Photos of warning notices about the four suspects had earlier circulated online, the newspaper said.
In November, Islamic State announced that it had murdered Fan Jinghui, a Chinese national it had been holding for ransom. The news was met with anxiety inside China as many Internet users questioned the government’s ability to protect its citizens abroad.
Below is a rough China Real Time translation of the lyrics:
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
To this day we guard the Koran and the Sunnah.
To this day we guard the Koran and the Sunnah.
To fight against those who fight you is Great Allah’s command.
To fight against those who fight you is Great Allah’s command.
To take up weapons in rebellion is Prophet Muhammad’s order
The brilliance of Islam is etched in history. The purpose of our struggle is to let it shine again.
The brilliance of Islam is etched in history. The purpose of our struggle is to let it shine again.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
(Note: An earlier version of this post quoted the song lyrics as saying “naked memory” instead of “shameful memory.” This version has been corrected.)

Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to flagship news outlets in Beijing comes amidst a growing debate among observers of Chinese politics about Xi’s political strength and longevity.
If China’s anticorruption crusade is working so well in cleaning up the Communist party, why is Beijing worried that some think that the campaign is really just a struggle for political power?
