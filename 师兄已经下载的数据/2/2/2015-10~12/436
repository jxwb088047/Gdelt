China's top graft-buster exposes decadent officials - Xinhua | English.news.cn
BEIJING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)'s top disciplinary agency on Monday named and shamed officials in 10 cases of violations as part of a major anti-decadence campaign on Monday.
The CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) released the names of around 40 officials involved in cases of embezzlement of public funds, use of public funds for banquets, accepting bribes, and holding lavish banquets, among other violations.
Those on the list are mainly low-level officials, ranging from village chiefs to county head. Punishments include warnings, demotions, dismissals, and expulsion from the CPC.
In one case, Cao Liansheng, former Party chief of Magongzhuang Village in north China's Hebei Province, was expelled from the CPC and transferred to judicial organs for embezzling public funds.
In another case, Hua Min, former Party chief of Qingyanghu Village in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, was demoted for holding a banquet using public funds and hindering an investigation into the alcohol-related death of one person at the banquet.
An eight-point rule was introduced at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the end of 2012 to fight bureaucracy and formalism and reject extravagance among Party members.
