We are in the midst of China's week-long National Day holiday, and events marking the occasion are being staged from east to west -- from northeast China's Liaoning Province all the way to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
The annual temple fair in Shenyang brings together more than 130 kinds of intangible cultural heritage. This year, more than 300 folk artisans are displaying their wares. Along with dough figurines, Liaoning Province is especially noted for its walnut sculpture. For example, this walnut - no bigger than a thumb - depicts 18 characters on its surface.

"We are having a great time here. I saw many exhibits that I used to see when I was a child and ate some traditional snacks. It brings back a lot of memories," said a man.
Heading west now to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, highly praised for its autumnal scenes.

"This is my first time here, and the scenery is gorgeous. There are a lot of colors: yellow, green, red, plus the snow-white mountains! It's really worth taking a holiday here," said woman.
"I drove my car here all the way from Chongqing, and I'm spending a couple of days here. We are going to take a whole lot of pictures. It's so beautiful! "
Besides the natural scenery, visitors can also get to know the history and culture of the region, which used to be an important stop along the Ancient Silk Road. 
More than three-and-a-half million tourists are expected to visit Xinjiang during the week-long National-Day holiday as China marks its first-ever "Silk Road Tourism Year".
