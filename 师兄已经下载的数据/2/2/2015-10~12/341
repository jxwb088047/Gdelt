Police: Arrested Uighur Terrorist Suspect Is A Key Figure | GIVnews.com - Indonesian Perspective To Global Audience
Jakarta, GIVnews.com – Terrorist suspect Abu Muzad who was arrested on Wednesday (22/12) in Bekasi, West Java, is a member of a Uighur separatist group based in the restive Xinjiang region in China, according to Jakarta police chief Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian.
“This Abu Muzad is a prime (terrorist) character,” Tito told reporters at his office on Friday (25/12), Detik.com reported.
Abu Muzad’s arrest had temporarily dashed a terrorist movement that is related to ISIS, the Jakarta police chief said. The terrorist suspect and his movement had circulated fatal threats against high-ranking police officers in the past months. The police, however, had more openly disclosed such threats only recently.
The National Police’s anti-terror squad, Densus 88, had hunted down Abu Muzad from Mojokerto (E. Java) to Tasik Malaya and Majenang (W. Java) before finally arresting him in Bekasi. Meanwhile, the anti-terror team is still searching for several followers of Abu Muzad.
In fact, far before the Paris attack, Indonesia had intensified its crackdown of Islamic militants from the so-called East Indonesia Mujahidin (MIT). They were reportedly based in Poso, Central Sulawesi.
The high-value target is MIT leader Abu Wardah alias Santoso.
