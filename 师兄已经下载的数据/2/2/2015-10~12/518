A Georgia cop responded to a domestic violence call involving a bipolar black man. After cuffing both his hands and feet, he tased him to death. He was given one month jail time, which he could serve on the weekends. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A former Georgia sheriff’s deputy, convicted for using a stun gun on a restrained detainee who later died alone in his cell, was sentenced on Friday to one month in jail and three years’ probation.
His conviction for cruelty of an inmate carried jail time of up to three years. But significantly shorter jail time was not the only way Chatham County superior court judge James Bass issued a more lenient sentence: he also allowed the former deputy to serve his time on the weekends.”*
