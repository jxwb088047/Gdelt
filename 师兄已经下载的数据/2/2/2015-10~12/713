An FBI anti-terrorism task force has caught and eighteen-year-old New York man who tried to buy automatic weapons from an undercover agent. The man said he wanted the weapons to “execute Jews and blacks.” Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A man from Whitehall, New York was indicted in federal court this week after an FBI anti-terrorism task forced discovered that he was buying fully automatic machine guns to allegedly “execute” minorities.
According to the Albany Times Union, a federal complaint accused 18-year-old Shane Robert Smith of buying weapons and ammunition from an undercover agent on Aug 6. The firearms included two weapons capable of firing as fully automatic machine guns: a Colt M16 model A2 and a Military Armament Corporation “MAC 10” machine gun.
Smith also acquired a Beretta model 92FS handgun and 120 rounds of armor-piercing “green-tip” ammunition.
The teen first showed up on investigators’ radar in May when he began buying machine guns online. Federal documents indicate that FBI investigators posed as gun sellers on a Russian social media website after Smith posted a request for automatic weapons.
The Post Star reported that Smith told undercover investigators that he needed the weapons to “execute kikes, coons and get money for the crew.”
Smith explained that he was building “a hit squad” and would need “a sidearm or heavy weapon” in case he got cornered.”*
