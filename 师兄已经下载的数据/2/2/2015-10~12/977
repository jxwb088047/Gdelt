Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council talks to Going Underground host Afshin Rattansi about British nuclear capability. With the Mutual Defence Agreement between the US and UK coming up for renewal, he explains it covers everything from Trident renewal to collaboration between scientists on research. He thinks it could be an opportunity to discuss whether it is in Britain’s best interest, but no such debate is happening. Without the agreement, it would cost twice as much to maintain nuclear weapons, but there is an assumption that this is in the UK’s best interests, but the real reason for nukes is not in case of needing them, but to ensure we remain America’s ‘special partner’. There is ‘utter dependence’ on the US to maintain the British nuclear systems any longer than a few months, so whilst they may claim ‘operational independence’ – the ability to fire without permission from the White House – there is massive reliance on the Americans. He also explains the position under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. With the NPT, nuclear weapons states can exchange technology, but cannot exchange warheads. The UK receives technology, shares submarines and missiles, but does not get warheads from the States, so the NPT is not, by the letter, broken. He believes this is dubious as it breaks the principles and intentions of the agreement, and the obligation to disarm. And whilst there are plenty of MPs who are doubtful over Britain possessing nuclear weapons, they consider it ‘political sui...

Trident nuclear weapons \'in UK\'s national interest\'

It is in the UK\'s national interest to keep the Trident nuclear weapons system, a group of former ministers, diplomats and generals have argued.

Maintaining a nuclear capability could help deter threats to the UK\'s security in future, the report by The Trident Commission concluded.

But they said continuous patrols could be relaxed while the UK must also show it is serious about working towards further international disarmament....

Afshin Rattansi goes underground on Trident. Major General Patrick Cordingley Commander of the Desert Rats in the first Gulf War and author of Number one bestseller ‘In the Eye of the Storm’ questions why are we forking out a hundred billion for Trident’s weapons of mass destruction? And does the UK really control the outdated nuclear weapons system that the taxpayer is paying for? Plus why are we spending money on nuclear weapons ‘that have not military use’ when our armed forces are so overstretched.

UK Nuclear Weapons Transport, Aldermaston to Coulport, November 2006. 
Note: although I believe that as a global society we should work towards nuclear disarmament; I am not one who advocates UK nuclear disarmament currently. With the waning power of the United States the world is set to get more dangerous again and a minimal deterrent such as is maintained by the UK is useful for the country itself and for Europe as a whole. If you look at the figures at the end of the video you will see that the UK actually has relatively few active warheads and has gradually reduced them over time. Both the USA and Russia maintain thousands of warheads and this needs to be reduced significantly. Gradual mutual reduction by all weapon states to minimal levels is the way forward....

The clip shows a nuclear weapons convoy passing Stirling fire station close on 7th December 2009 on its way to the bomb depot at Coulport on Loch Long. The two large green carriers may be empty or may be carrying nuclear warheads containing plutonium and high explosive. Incidentally the fire officers are not told in advance that a convoy is on its way....

The United Kingdom was the first country to set up a nuclear program and, in 1952, became the third country to test an independently developed nuclear weapon. It is one of the five Nuclear Weapons States following its 1968 ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The UK is thought to retain a stockpile of around 225 thermonuclear warheads, of which 160 are operational, but has refused to declare the exact size of its arsenal.
The delivery system consists of four Vanguard class submarines based at HMNB Clyde in Scotland. Each submarine is armed with up to 16 Trident II missiles, each carrying warheads in up to eight MIRV re-entry vehicles. With at least one submarine always on patrol, the Vanguards perform a strategic deterrence role and are also believed to have a sub-strategic capability.
Since the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the United States and the United Kingdom have cooperated extensively on nuclear security matters. The special relationship between the two countries has involved the exchange of classified scientific data and materials such as plutonium.
