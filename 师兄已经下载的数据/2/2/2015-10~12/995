BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday met with 13 representatives from the five autonomous regions, invited to the National Day celebrations for their contribution to ethnic unity.
The five autonomous regions, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet, Ningxia and Xinjiang, host the majority of population of the nation's ethnic groups, which account for nearly one tenth of the total population.
Xi acknowledged the representatives' devotion to ethnic solidarity. "I wish to take this opportunity to convey to you, your fellow folks and all the 56 ethnic groups, my best wishes and festival greetings."
All people of various ethnic groups have created the People's Republic of China, and made outstanding contributions to the nation's development, the president said.
"I have stressed many times that not a single ethnic group should be left behind in the process of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society," he said.
He urged people from all ethnic groups to love each other like brothers and sisters, exchange more and make efforts to safeguard unity.
Two representatives, the Enwaer sisters from Xinjiang, spent two months making an embroidery inscribed with words "striving for the Chinese dream with one heart." They have sent the embroidery to Xi as a gift.
"We've never expected to be invited here to celebrate National Day. It's the greatest honor of my life," the sisters said.
