The newspaper Daily News made controversy with their front page line, “God isn’t fixing this” after the San Bernardino mass shooting. This was referring to the constant stream of prayers in lieu of policy action on the Republican side. Twitter user Igor Volsky took the time to point out how much those meaningless prayer tweets cost the NRA. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Following Wednesday afternoon’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which left at least 14 people dead, numerous lawmakers tweeted their “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of the gruesome tragedy. But many of the same congresspeople who were quick to publicly register their feelings about the 352nd mass shooting this year, received thousands of dollars from the National Rifle Association and voted against sensible gun reforms like expanding background checks to more gun purchases.”*

In the wake of the San Bernardino massacre, the National Rifle Association lost no time in launching its attack against the inevitable demands for greater gun control.

With a video asserting that packing a gun is the safest option against the “demons among us,\" the NRA’s ubiquitous executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre played the fear card for all it was worth. 

He said, “When evil knocks on our doors, Americans have a power no other people on the planet share: the full-throated right to defend our families and ourselves with our second amendment.\"

The NRA, he added, is “freedom’s safest place”.

Following the mass shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino, in which 14 people were killed, presidential candidates expressed their condolences and spoke out about the killings – but only the Democratic candidates seemed to call for action on gun control. Here we compare the candidates’ statements with their National Rifle Association ratings. The pro-gun lobby group gives politicians a grade ranging from A to F that reflects their voting record on gun rights. Some candidates who do not have a legislative track record on second amendment issues do not yet have NRA scores.

San Bernardino Mass Shooting
At about 11am Wednesday, after dropping their 6 year old daughter off with a grandmother, a husband and wife opened fire in San Bernardino at a party in the Inland Regional Center. 14 people were killed. 17 were wounded. The husband and wife fled the scene in a black SUV, leaving behind three explosive devices that were destroyed by bomb squad officers, according to San Bernardino police Chief Jarrod Burguan.

The husband, 28 year old Syed Rizwan Farook, an American citizen who was employed was an environmental health specialist with the San Bernardino County health department, which was hosting the holiday party at Inland Regional. He had been at the party earlier and left after an altercation. He returned, along with his 27-year-old wife, Tashfeen Malik and they were dressed in what was described as tactical gear and wearing masks. After fleeing in a black SUV, the couple was killed by law enforcement.

Police have not ascribed a motive yet.
