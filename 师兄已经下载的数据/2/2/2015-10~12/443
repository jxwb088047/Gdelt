China moves to squash dissent in Buddhist, Muslim regions | TribLIVE
BEIJING — China has mounted an extraordinary set of attacks against its own cadres in its troubled western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, accusing some of disloyalty to the Communist Party, of secretly participating in religious activities, sympathizing with the Dalai Lama or even supporting terrorist attacks.
The accusations form part of a hardening of the party's stance both in Buddhist Tibet and Muslim-majority Xinjiang, experts said, as well as President Xi Jinping's determination to push for ideological purity within the party nationwide, with a quashing of intra-party debate and dissent.
An article on China Tibet Online, a party website, published Friday, said 355 cadres had been punished in Xinjiang last year for violating “political discipline.”
Some officials blamed social problems on ethnic discrimination, the article complained, thus inciting ethnic hatred. “There is also a lack of faith in Marxism. Some grassroots party members even participate in religious activities,” its author, Zhao Zhao, wrote, adding that this would never be allowed.

We moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.
While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.
We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments â either by the same reader or different readers.
We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.
We do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.
We welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.
We appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.
