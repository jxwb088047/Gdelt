As more details come to light about the death of 17-year old Laquan McDonald, the more it seems that the Chicago police department is involved in a massive cover-up. On the night of October 20, 2014 McDonald was shot sixteen times by Chicago police officers.

McDonald was gunned down near a Burger King, where police responded to a call about a suspicious man with a knife, or so they say. Very few details are actually known about the events that transpired leading up to the young man’s death. However, police claim that the young boy posed a serious threat to their lives, so they had no choice but to draw their weapons and shoot him over a dozen times.

According to the Medical Examiners report, nine of sixteen the shots hit McDonald in the back.

Police had stalked the young man through the parking lot of the Burger King, claiming that they were looking for a suspect, but instead they approached McDonald and ended up shooting him.

While details are unclear as a result of the cover-up, it is likely that the young man was not entirely cooperative with officers because he was innocent and just minding his own business and did not want to be bothered. These natural and understandable objections to being stopped and hassled by police can many times escalate into a murder.

Not only do the police refuse to release the dash camera footage from their patrol car, but they have also confiscated and deleted o...

Officer Jason Van Dyke has been charged with murder over a year after shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. A judge ruled that footage of the shooting be released. The footage showed that the officer’s claim of the victim lunging at him was a lie. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"After a prolonged legal battle, Chicago police released a video of one of their officers, Jason Van Dyke, shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times Wednesday.
The video shows McDonald carrying a small knife, walking away from Van Dyke before the officer opens fire. The entire shooting took about 15 seconds, and McDonald was lying on the ground for 13 of them. An officer appears to kick at McDonald’s body after shooting him.
Van Dyke was finally charged with first degree murder more than a year after the shooting. Though State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez has had the video for a year, the charges came days after a judge ordered the police to release the damning footage. City leaders quickly started scrambling to do damage control ahead of the release, realizing the video’s contents would inflame longstanding rage against Chicago PD’s rampant abuses. Chicago police killed more people than any other comparably sized police departments from 2010 to 2014.”*

Chicago is bracing for several new developments in the police-involved death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was shot and killed over a year ago. Officer Jason Van Dyke will reportedly be charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday, and the city has until Wednesday to release the video footage of the shooting, ordered last week by Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama. An autopsy report shows McDonald was shot 16 times on October 20, 2014, including multiple times in the back. Police have said that the teenager lunged at the officer with a small knife. But people who have seen the video from police dashcam footage say it contradicts the police account, instead showing Van Dyke opening fire on the teenager while he was walking away, and continuing to shoot him even after the teenager was lying on the pavement. Despite the fact that McDonald’s family did not file a lawsuit, the city paid them $5 million in April and fought to conceal the video, even after the Wall Street Journal, the Chicago Tribune and a freelance journalist all filed FOIA requests for its release. Van Dyke remains on paid desk duty, as the shooting is investigated by the FBI and the United States attorney’s office in Chicago. For more we are joined by Jamie Kalven, founder of the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit journalism outlet that recently released tens of thousands of pages of civilian complaints filed against the Chicago Police Department — 97 percent of which resulted in absolutely no disciplinary action. Kalven is also the freelance journalist who uncovered Laquan McDonald’s autopsy report.

**Fight Censorship on YouTube**

Chicago, Ill. -- Reports, released by the city late Friday, show that Officer Jason Van Dyke and at least five other officers claim that the 17-year-old McDonald moved or turned threateningly toward officers, even though the video of the October 2014 shooting shows McDonald walking away, and the scenario sketched out by Cook County State\'s Attorney Anita Alvarez in charging Van Dyke with murder contends he was walking away as well.

At least one patrol officer said McDonald was advancing on the officers in a menacing way and swung his knife at them in an \"aggressive, exaggerated manner\" before he was shot and killed. Officers claimed, too, that even after McDonald had been shot by Van Dyke, the teen tried to lift himself off the ground with the knife pointed toward the officers, and though he had been mortally wounded, still presented a threat.

The Chicago police officer who fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald has been charged with first-degree murder, a major turn that comes as many in the city braced for potential unrest.

The Cook County State\'s Attorney announced Tuesday that the Chicago officer, Jason Van Dyke, turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday morning. He is scheduled to appear in court around noon (1 p.m. ET) for a bond hearing.

Until Tuesday, Van Dyke still worked for the police department in a \"limited duty position\" as investigators probed the October 20, 2014, shooting death of McDonald.

Authorities say McDonald, 17, was armed with a 4-inch knife when Van Dyke, who is white, confronted him. The teen did not comply with \"numerous police orders to drop the knife,\" the officer\'s lawyer, Daniel Herbert, told the Chicago Tribune, when Van Dyke opened fire. McDonald died after being shot 16 times.

\"He\'s scared to death, but more than himself he\'s scared for his wife, his two kids,\" Herbert said of his client, prior to charges being filed. \"He knows in his heart of hearts that his actions were appropriate.\"...
