Ethan Couch was the young man who used the “affluenza” defense when he was on trial for killing four people in a drunk driving accident in 2013. He only got probation for that incident and now it seems he may have violated it. Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian (The Point), Ben Mankiewicz (What The Flick?!), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show) hosts of The Young Turks discuss.

Will Couch go to jail? Let us know in the comments below.

“Texas’ infamous “affluenza” teen Ethan Couch, on probation for four counts of intoxication manslaughter, after he struck and killed four people while going 70 mph in a 40 mph zone in 2013, is under investigation for potentially violating the terms of his probation.

On Wednesday, a Twitter user posted a video to the site allegedly showing Couch, now 18 years old, playing beer pong. Couch’s probation states that he cannot drive, drink alcohol, or use drugs for 10 years. The Tarrant County District Attorney’s office and the City of Burleson were tagged in the tweet.”

Authorities said a Texas teenager serving probation for killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck after invoking an \"affluenza\" defense was in custody in Mexico, weeks after he and his mother disappeared.

The public affairs department of the prosecutors\' office in Mexico\'s Jalisco state said 18-year-old Ethan Couch and his mother, Tonya Couch, 48, were detained in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta around 6:00 p.m. Monday.

Drunk-driving teen who killed 4 too rich for jail, critics argue
Ethan Couch was charged as a juvenile with four counts of intoxication manslaughter.
Prosecutors said Couch\'s alcohol level was three times the legal limit when he caused the chain reaction crash June 15 in Burleson, and there were seven other teens in the pickup, including two in the bed. 
(TorontoSun) AUSTIN - A decision by a Texas judge this week to give an affluent teenager probation after he killed four people while driving drunk has sparked a backlash and complaints of a miscarriage of justice.
State District Judge Jean Boyd on Tuesday sentenced the 16-year-old boy to 10 years probation and ordered him to get therapy. The teen was driving a pickup truck when he ran down four people who were helping fix a vehicle at the roadside in the Fort Worth area.
A psychologist for the defence said the teen suffered from \"affluenza\", a condition where a person feels shielded from problems by money, having led a life of privilege paid for by his parents, local media reported.
The four people killed in the June incident were Breanna Mitchell, whose car broke down, Hollie and Shelby Boyles, who lived nearby and came out to help and youth minister Brian Jennings, who stopped to help, the Fort Worth Star Telegram reported.
The paper has been flooded with comments on the sentence, almost all of which were critical of the judge.

\"It is a slap in the face to people who rely on the justice system and just reinforces the idea that the best defence is loads of money,\" Shirley Watson wrote in a comment to the paper on Thursday...

A forensics team with the Tarrant County District Attorney\'s Office is investigating a video burning up Twitter, purportedly showing \"affluenza\" teen Ethan Couch at a party where people were playing beer pong.

Couch received 10 years of probation after driving drunk and killing four people. He was 16 years old at the time, with Judge Jean Boyd drawing scorn for sentencing him to treatment and probation, but no time locked up in a juvenile justice center.

He became a household name because of his \"affluenza\" defense, claiming he was raised as a rich kid who never knew consequences.

The issue is whether or not it would be a violation of his conditions of probation, which includes not drinking alcohol. The DA would like to hear from other witnesses at the party before deciding.

In the video, you can see beer cans stacked up as a guy with a with a ping pong ball leaps onto a table lined with cups. A young man shown laughing at the antics looks a lot like Couch, who is now 18.
