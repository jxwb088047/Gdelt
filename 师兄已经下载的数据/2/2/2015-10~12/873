Yellow Ribbons and Endless War - Worldnews.com

"By God," Bush said in triumph, "we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all."
This was Bush 41, a quarter of a century ago, celebrating the terrific poll numbers his kwik-win war on Iraq was generating. Remember yellow

“Long before Americans were introduced to the new 9/11 era super-villains called ISIS and Khorasan, senior Obama officials were openly and explicitly stating that America’s “war on terror,” already 12 years old, would last at least another decade. At first, they injected these decrees only anonymously; in late 2012, The Washington Post - disclosing the administration’s secret creation of a “disposition matrix” to decide who should be killed, imprisoned without charges, or otherwise “disposed” of - reported these remarkable facts:

Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaida continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is in sight. . . . That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.”

In May, 2013, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on whether it should revise the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). A committee member asked a senior Pentagon official, Assistant Secretary Michael Sheehan, how long the war on terror would last; his reply: “At least 10 to 20 years.” At least.\"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

Democracynow.org - The White House has announced a team of special operations forces numbering less than 50 will be sent to Syria. This marks the first sustained U.S. troop presence in Syria since President Obama launched a bombing campaign against the self-proclaimed Islamic State in September 2014. It’s also a reversal of Obama’s repeated promise of no U.S. boots on the ground in Syria, a pledge he also violated in Iraq. One day after the announcement, the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross made what they called an \"unprecedented joint warning\" for states to end wars, respect international law and aid the 60 million refugees made homeless from recent conflicts. We are joined by Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies, author of several books, including \"Understanding ISIS and the New Global War on Terror.\"

http://democracynow.org - As the United States begins bombing the Iraqi city of Tikrit and again delays a withdrawal from Afghanistan, a new report has found that the Iraq War has killed about one million people. The Nobel Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and other groups examined the toll from the so-called war on terror in three countries — Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The investigators found \"the war has, directly or indirectly, killed around one million people in Iraq, 220,000 in Afghanistan and 80,000 in Pakistan. Not included in this figure are further war zones such as Yemen. The figure is approximately 10 times greater than that of which the public, experts and decision makers are aware. ... And this is only a conservative estimate.\" The true tally, they add, could be more than two million. We are joined by two guests who worked on the report: Hans von Sponeck, former U.N. assistant secretary-general and U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, who in 2000 resigned his post in protest of the U.S.-led sanctions regime; and Dr. Robert Gould, president of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility.

This as the White House weighs up whether to start preparations for a total withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of the year. The signing of a bilateral security deal may look unlikely at the moment, but Washington is reluctant to release its hold on the region, as RT\'s Gayane Chichakyan explains..

The U.S. military has admitted that major mistakes were made during its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a report that showed flaws in training and policy. It also highlighted a lack of understanding over the realities faced by troops. Now, it seems the country\'s war veterans are joining an increasingly-angry public, over what they see as America\'s constant cycle of war. With some even ditching their honours of valour - as Anastasia Churkina explains.

Wars never stop in the world. And after the world wars local wars begin. Confrontation of neighbors are replaced by conflicts between countries remote from each other. The reasons for war are not changed since ancient times, but the initiative is intercepted all the time by a new country- one that becomes predominant force. Today it is the United States. Why the endless conflicts around the world are so beneficial for the States?


Koltashov Vassiliy, director of the Center for Economic Research Institute of Globalization and Social Movements: \"Wars are profitable, either directly in the form of a source of orders, and indirectly, as they provide the elimination of competitors. For example, the formation of Daesh and its strengthening, as well as actions in the Middle East are certainly beneficial for the United States. Because the United States is least like to leave the Middle East. To leave Iraq in a state where a kind of independent economic state is capable of generating, economically prosperous state, which will carry out some policy of development, which restore the industry, which, ultimately, provide a threat to the dominance of US corporations, and thus the American political hegemony. It is therefore advantageous to remain chaos. So that civil wars that occur, military conflicts, the establishment of a radical Islamist movements- this is all indirectly very beneficial to the United States. \"...

An analyst says despite the astronomical cost of US Afghan presence and the American public and military\'s opposition to staying in the country, it could end up becoming what President Bush initiated as \'endless war.\' The comment comes as Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that the United States violated international human rights when its military carried out a deadly airstrike in the eastern province of Kunar. The Afghan president made the remarks on Saturday after his government\'s investigation into the April 6 incident raised the Afghan civilian death toll from 11 to 17, including 12 children and four women. Karzai also stated that foreign troops breached his decree, which barred airstrikes in residential areas, and described the move as \"unacceptable.\" 

Press TV has conducted an interview with James Jennings, President of Conscience International, in Atlanta to further discuss this issue.

You\'re not some small fry out there saying that Bin ladin was dead and what you talked about on my show was confirmed by people in the white house, high level and then separately years after that Madeline Albright former secretary of state came out and said it. Benazir Bhutto the president of Pakistan said it.
So when the Washington Post and everybody makes fun of us right now and has these articles out some of them wouldn\'t even quote you they just said that Jones claimed he had a source from the state department when it was on record.

I talked to one white house official then another person well known to me, got it from another white house source I\'m just going to leave it at that. So two sources that I actually talked to, one on air, one privately then the other through someone that I know for decades who was told the same information.

And they (I) said this isn\'t a rumor right? 

They said no, he\'s dead.

Pieczenik: As a physician I had known that the CIA physicians had treated him and it was on the intelligence roster that he had Marfans syndrome.

Alex reads Pieczenik bio: Dr. Steve Pieczenik served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and senior policy planner under secretaries Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, George Schultz (talk about knowing where the bodies are buried)

You\'re not some small fry out there saying that Bin ladin was dead and what you talked about on my show was confirmed by people in the white house, high level and then separately years after that Madeline Albright former secretary of state came out and said it.

So when the Washington Post and everybody makes fun of us right now and has these articles out some of them wouldn\'t even quote you they just said that Jones claimed he had a source from the state department when it was on record.

I talked to one white house official then another person well known to me, got it from another white house source I\'m just going to leave it at that.

And they (I) said this isn\'t a rumor right?

Mirrored and published with the permission of: Democracynow.org - The White House has announced a team of special operations forces numbering less than 50 will be sent to Syria. This marks the first sustained U.S. troop presence in Syria since President Obama launched a bombing campaign against the self-proclaimed Islamic State in September 2014. It’s also a reversal of Obama’s repeated promise of no U.S. boots on the ground in Syria, a pledge he also violated in Iraq. One day after the announcement, the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross made what they called an \"unprecedented joint warning\" for states to end wars, respect international law and aid the 60 million refugees made homeless from recent conflicts. We are joined by Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies, author of several books, including \"Understanding ISIS and the New Global War on Terror.\"...
