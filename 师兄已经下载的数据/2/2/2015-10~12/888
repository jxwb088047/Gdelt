US sources: China tests new 'DN-3' interceptor missile | IHS Jane's 360
China tested a new 'direct ascent' missile interceptor called the Dong Neng-3 (DN-3) on 30 October from its Korla Missile Text Complex in Xinjiang, according to US government sources.
China issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) on 30 October for events from late 31 October to 1 November for the region southeast of Korla used for a 23 July 2014 missile interception test.
Confirmation of a missile test on 30 October by a US government source, and the new DN-3 designation, was reported on 9 November by the Washington Free Beacon.
Unlike some previous tests, the Chinese government has not issued confirmation of this latest test, although by 1 November several Chinese websites were displaying images of night-time missile contrails consistent with anti-missile tests.
