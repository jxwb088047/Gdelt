China Hits Uighurs in Xinjiang - The American Interest
Chinese security forces have killed 17 suspected Uighur “militants” in Xinjiang, in response to a knife attack on a coal mine in September that left 50 Han Chinese dead. Reuters reports on the deaths, which come after Beijing asked the international community for help in fighting what it described as a terrorist threat in its own restive west:
Radio Free Asia, citing Xinjiang police, said the 17 killed were all suspects in the attack, including three men believed to have been the ringleaders and their family members.
Reports indicated that security forces blew up a cave where the militants were hiding, and that several women and children numbered among them.
