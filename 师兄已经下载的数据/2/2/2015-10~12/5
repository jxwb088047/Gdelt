Americans fear a terror attack - but we love our country more. That is why we need to take a stand against the anti-Muslim scapegoating that followed the tragic shooting rampage in San Bernardino. Everyone has fear. Fear of danger, fear of failure, fear of success. Being a grownup means being able to manage your fear. Being a political leader is being able to channel your fear...
The latest rhetorical barrage from presidential candidate Donald Trump came on Monday evening, when the Republican front-runner called for a "total and complete shutdown" of the entry of Muslims to the United States "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on." That demand — as sweeping as it is incendiary — led to a firestorm on social media as well as...

Donald Trump’s plan to ban muslims from entering the country has crossed a line that most of the Republican establishment won’t. They’re almost universal in criticizing him. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Today, Donald Trump advocated a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The proposal has its roots in the radical fringe of anti-Muslim activists in America. Trump’s campaign made clear it would apply to tourists, refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants — and even Muslim-Americans who are currently abroad.

Several of his competitors for the Republican nomination quickly condemned Trump’s proposal. Even Jeb Bush, who advocated a religious test to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim, blasted the proposal.
But other candidates reactions were much more muted. Rand Paul’s response to Trump’s comments does not condemn Trump’s proposal or even mention it. Instead, he touted his own plan to keep Muslims out of America.”*

There is a silver lining to all the Donald Trump madness. Did you ever think in a million years that Fox News would be defending Muslims? Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"“I disagree,” Trump replied. “People have to be vetted. This is about security, it’s not about religion, and we cannot allow people to come into this country who have horrible things in their minds.”

When O’Reilly tendered that “I don’t think you have thought through the unintended consequences of banning an entire religion from coming to the United States,” the ever-humble Trump replied, “I have thought through everything, believe me.”

Trump later said that Islamic extremism is “a very, very serious problem, and somebody had to bring it up. Maybe it’s not politically correct to do it, but somebody had to bring it up. And a lot of people are very thankful I did it.””*

CAIR Asks Donald Trump to Apologize to Muslim Woman Abused by Crowd, Kicked Out of Rally

(WASHINGTON, D.C., 1/8/16) - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to offer a public apology to a Muslim woman verbally abused by the crowd and kicked out of one of his campaign rallies tonight in South Carolina.

Video: Muslim Woman Abused by Crowd, Kicked Out of Donald Trump Rally Interviewed by CNN 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0YBt_6HfbM

“The image of a Muslim woman being abused and ejected from a political rally sends a chilling message to American Muslims and to all those who value our nation’s traditions of religious diversity and civic participation,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. “Donald Trump should issue a public apology to the Muslim woman kicked out of his rally and make a clear statement that American Muslims are welcome as fellow citizens and as participants in the nation’s political process.”

Awad also called on Trump to meet with American Muslim leaders to help stem the anti-Muslim hysteria resulting from his rhetoric and that of other GOP presidential candidates.

Last month, CAIR joined other national American Muslim organizations in condemning a Trump policy statement “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”
