Boy Killed Because His Dads In A Gang
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 9, 2015Leave a Comment
Tyshawn Lee was walking to his grandmother’s house when he was shot and killed. It is believed that the boy is the victim of gang violence, because his father is in a gang. However, police say the father isn’t cooperating. Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian (The Point), Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show), and Mark Thompson hosts of The Young Turks discuss.
Will the legalization of drugs solve the problem of gangs? Let us know in the comments below.
“A 9-year-old Chicago boy who was fatally shot this week was “lured” from a park into an alley and executed because of his father’s alleged gang connections, police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said Thursday in a crime he described as among the most “unfathomable” of his 35 years in policing.
Tyshawn Lee, an elementary school student headed to his grandmother’s house, was shot in the head and back Monday in a neighborhood alley on the city’s South Side.
McCarthy told reporters Thursday that the slaying was the result of two gangs fighting, potentially in a string of retaliatory events dating back months. He said the boy’s father isn’t cooperating with police.
McCarthy called it probably the “most abhorrent, cowardly unfathomable crime that I’ve witnessed in 35 years of policing.”
