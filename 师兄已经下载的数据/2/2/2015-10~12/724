China’s fight against terror in photos
Chinese soldiers patrol the streets of a Uighur neighborhood in Urumqi, Xinjiang province, China.
Pictures showing armed Chinese police dressed in black with helmets and balaclavas getting ready to storm a house in a rural region were shown on Chinese state media on November 14. The nine photos were reportedly taken during a mission to combat militants in the far west region of Xinjiang.
As reported by Reuters, China’s government has repeatedly blamed attacks in the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people, and other parts of the country on Islamist militants.
“France’s Paris was hit by its worst terrorist attack in history, with hundreds dead and injured. On the other side of the world, police in China’s Xinjiang, after 56 days of pursuing and attacking, carried out a full attack on the terrorists and got great results,” reads the text accompanying the pictures.
The post appeared to originate on an official microblog run by China’s public security ministry, but was then removed, though remained widely available on other state-run media microblogs.
A letter shown as part of the pictures says that after a 56-day battle, “it finally ended at 4:40pm today”.
According to Reuters, parts of the letter were pixelated out and warned that those who perpetrated violence will be severely dealt with.
Meanwhile, human rights groups and many foreign experts doubt there exists the cohesive militant Islamist group in Xinjiang that the government claims, and say the violence stems from popular anger at Chinese controls on religion and culture.
