Ben Carson Endorses Donald Trump | MSNBC
Brought to you by Bill Luke: http://billluke.com
THE MOST AWKWARD Stand By Me Cover EVER - Donald Trump Ben Carson Dance on Stage - FNN
Ben Carson is going to be endorsing Donald Trump tomorrow, according to reports.

Both The Washington Post and ABC News are saying tonight that the former GOP candidate is throwing his support to the current Republican frontrunner amid much fighting in the party and resistance to the idea of Trump as the nominee.

Carson has spoken often about a campaign more focused on lightness, healing, and coming together, so naturally he’s putting his support behind this guy:

Trump Likens Carson’s Early ‘Pathological’ Behavior to Child Molesters
‘One of Many Lies’: Trump Quick to Pounce on Carson Over West Point Report
Trump: Something ‘Very Strange’ About Carson Stories, He’s Made ‘Troubling Statements’
Trump Goes After ‘Very, Very Weak’ Ben Carson After Dropping in Iowa Poll
Trump Responds to Carson Lead in Iowa By Insulting Voters’ Intelligence
Trump Hits Back at Ben Carson: He’s the One Faking His Faith

Oh, and not to mention all this:

Carson: Of Course Trump’s a Typical Politician, He Does Whatever’s Expedient for Him
Carson Swipes at Trump: Difference Between Being Politically Incorrect And Being ‘Mean’

And literally last week Carson was calling for a meeting between all the candidates to talk about the lack of civility in the race.

So that presser tomorrow should be fun.

Ben Carson confirms backing for Donald Trump for US presidency
Former Republican hopeful Ben Carson has confirmed his support for his former rival and front-runner Donald Trump in the US presidential race.
He made the endorsement at a joint news conference in Florida with Mr Trump, ahead of primaries there on Tuesday.
The winner of the Republican nomination will face Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, in November.
Mr Carson is the second former candidate to endorse Mr Trump after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
A retired neurosurgeon, Mr Carson was an early frontrunner but dropped out last week after failing to gain significant popular support.
"I have found in talking with him, that there's a lot more alignment, philosophically and spiritually, than I ever thought that there was," Mr Carson said of his former rival.
"Donald Trump talks a lot about making America great. It's not just talk, he means it," he added.
The endorsement follows a debate in Miami on Thursday night between Mr Trump and his remaining rivals Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.
Mr Trump, a billionaire businessman from New York with no political experience, has dominated the state primary contests so far.

Donald Trump held a press conference today from the Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, FL. Ben Carson attended the event, where he handed the mogul his endorsement. Carson says a house divided against itself cannot stand and together the country will “ascend to a much higher pinnacle” than anyone expects Carson sees spiritual alignment with Trump Carson’s speaking at a Trump event in Palm Beach. Trump is waiting in the wings. Carson’s standing behind a Trump-branded lectern in front of Trump’s usual backdrop of American flags. “There’s a lot more alignment, philosophically and spiritually, than I ever thought there was,” Carson says of himself and Trump.
 “I’m appealing to the media, as well. You’re part of America, too,” Carson advises. He says the job of the media should be not to divide or sow conflict, but to unite. “Donald Trump talks a lot about making America great, but it’s not just talk – he means it,” Carson says.
Carson endorses Trump: he's 'very cerebral' “I’ll tell you why. First of all, I’ve come to know Donald Trump ... he is actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about America.” Carson says there are two Trumps. One you see onstage and a secret Trump backstage, who Carson says is “very cerebral”.Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump at a press conference this morning, which comes as a surprise to some considering the exceedingly nasty feuds and disagreements they had as political rivals. Carson took the stage first, singing Trump’s praises and saying they “buried the hatchet,” but as soon as Trump took questions, the mogul was asked about whether he ever actually apologized for the attacks he threw at the former doctor. Trump brushed off the concerns, saying “it’s politics, it’s a tough business,” but he was pressed to elaborate as the subject became a prevalent theme of the news conference. “It’s politics. Ben understands that, and I was really impressed with the way he fought back, because he fought back with silence and strength,” Trump said. “I couldn’t lose him. I couldn’t shake him, he did so well and just go up, up, up, so steady, so solid, and I hit him hard. And he understands that.” Carson’s softer demeanor has been one of the many aspects Trump previously chose to mock, but the plutocrat claimed today that he now respects the dignity Carson showed during the race. "Some people said he said terrible things about you ... well first of all we buried the hatchet. ... That happens in American politics. “There’s a lot more alignment, philosophically and spiritually, than I ever thought there was,” Carson says.
Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Retired brain surgeon Ben Carson will endorse Donald Trump this morning in an appearance in Florida, Trump announced from the debate stage last night. Carson said on Thursday that it was important for the Republican party to get behind its nominee to ensure the defeat of the Democrats in November. Carson also said he believed that Trump was attracting new voters to the GOP. But some longtime Carson supporters expressed disappointment that a leader they had valued for his even temperament and Christian values would now get behind a candidate not known for either. “Let’s hope it is just a bad rumor, otherwise a lot of Dr Carson fans will be heartbroken,” said old Carson friend and former campaign organizer Terry Giles in a statement to the Guardian on Thursday evening. (Read the full statement here.)
Ever since the Carson endorsement plan was announced, those who care have busied themselves disinterring Trump’s greatest hits against Carson, including this one:

Ben Carson has thrown his support behind Donald Trump. This could be significant because it could send more of his supporters to Trump than otherwise would have gone. Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola (ThinkTank), and Jimmy Dore, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"Ben Carson—a man Donald Trump once compared to a child molester—just endorsed Donald Trump, calling Trump’s accusations “political stuff.”

“We buried the hatchet,” Carson said. “I do recognize that it is part of the process. We move on.”

Carson also suggested there are “two Donald Trumps”: The one we have to deal with and one that’s more “cerebral.”

“I’m a big thinker,” Trump confirmed after the endorsement.

Trump also denied making a deal with Carson in exchange for the endorsement but did say, “Ben’s going to have a big part” in the campaign.”*
