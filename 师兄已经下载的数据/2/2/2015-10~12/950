Turkistan Islamic Party shows US-made machine gun, captured drone | The Long War Journal
A fighter on the front lines is pictured with a Browning machine gun.
Correction: The article initially described the machine gun as a M2 Browning, but it is a 1919 Browning. The article has been updated to note this change.
The Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), an al Qaeda-affiliated Uighur jihadist group, has released photos from the fighting in the Al Ghab plain in northwest Syria.
In one of the pictures, a Browning 1919 machine gun can be seen set up near the front lines of the fighting. It is unclear how the jihadist group obtained the weapon, but it may have been taken during fighting between the jihadists and US-support rebel groups. Al Nusrah Front, an official branch of al Qaeda, turned on two US-backed rebel groups in northern Syria last year.
However, the weapon also could have been provided by US-supported groups that are allied with the TIP and Al Nusrah. Rebel groups supplied by the US are fighting alongside jihadists in the area.
The Uighur al Qaeda group also claims to have captured a downed Syrian reconnaissance drone, which can be seen below.

that is not a M2 Browning ( which is .50 caliber, it is more like a Browning
Model 1917 in .30 caliber ( 30.06 ) last used by the US military in the late 1950s
The ‘captured drone’ is a little DJI Phantom 3 Professional available from store.dji.com for USD $1,259. It’s range is only 3.1 miles from the controller (unobstructed line of sight) and is armed with a camera. Max speed is only 16m/sec if there is no wind so an Islamist with a few rocks could bring one down.
The headline would have you believe its a sophisticated military drone in the hands of these jihadists and this is a story of great technical interest and fears
This is a run of the mill commercially hobbyist available drone available to anyone with a credit card
I believe that is the camera dangling on the bottom
The drone is incomplete – notice several props of the quadcopter are missing
Secondly there is no controller related to the device
Supposing the new holders could buy the right props online and have them delivered they will need the controller device
Of course the Browning looks tight,…but the “drone” looks like it came from radio shack.
Yes the drone appears to be a standard Phantom Drone model
Typically the stripes are a red colour
In this case they are a gold or orange
Perhaps its sun fade or customization for better camouflage
Early models were approx $ 1000 US and had 8 minutes or less flying time with camera on
The current model with camera ( Phantom 3) has approx 28 minutes flying time
Phantom 3 Standard
Special Price: USD $699

Actually, it is a Browning M2 .50cal. There are several indicators of this. First is the size of the cartridges hanging from the feed port. These are clearly .50BMG and not .30-06 or 8mm. The spade grips are common to the .50cal series Brownings, but not in its smaller cousins. Additionally, the front and rear sights are those of the 50cal family. The .30 caliber versions featured a rear leaf site and a folding front site. The size of the buffer (the cylinder located between the spade grips) indicates of that this is an M2 .50 and not an M3.
Actually the markings ( and color of gold rather than older Phantom drone standard trim) indicate this is the most current version of the Phantom 3 – the Phantom “3” Drone
