Ted Cruz Doesn't Trust Trump's Finger On The Button - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Chris HouckDecember 14, 2015Leave a Comment
Ted Cruz has been extremely hesitant to criticize Donald Trump in public at least, but behind closed doors he finally worked up the courage to tell someone how he feels. Word got out, and Trump wasted no time responding. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), and Mark Thompson, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Donald J. Trump said last month that he was prepared to “go to war” with Senator Ted Cruz if the Republican from Texas continued to gain strength. It appears the fight is on.
On Friday, after Mr. Cruz told a private gathering of donors that Mr. Trump’s campaign was destined to collapse, the billionaire developer dared him to challenge him publicly…
According to an audio recording from the donor event on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz offered faint praise of Mr. Trump and Ben Carson before saying, “I don’t believe either one of them is going to be our president.” He questioned their judgment and qualifications for the job at a time of growing fears about terrorism.
“People run as who they are. I believe gravity will bring both of those campaigns down,” Mr. Cruz said. “The lion’s share of their supporters come to us.””*
