Trump Goes OFF On Ben Carson's Knife Story
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 14, 2015Leave a Comment
We’ve long suspected that when Donald Trump loses his advantage in the polls he would be unlikely to respond in a rational, mature fashion. Now he’s losing to Ben Carson. Trump didn’t disappoint. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and Elliot Hill (The Lip TV), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“During a 95-minute speech Thursday, Donald Trump delivered a scathing attack on Ben Carson, his closest rival in the polls for the Republican presidential nomination.
It makes for the primary’s most fascinating moment thus far.
Had traitor RINOs in the GOP establishment or godless liberals in the mainstream media told Iowa Republicans that the retired neurosurgeon is like a child molester and that his supporters are stupid, the base would’ve erupted with fury. It’s just like those coastal elites to be egregiously unfair to a nice man like Carson.”*
