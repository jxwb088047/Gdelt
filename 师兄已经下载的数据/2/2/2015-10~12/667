Man Screams At Muslim In Restaurant, Fights Employees... - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Chris HouckDecember 14, 2015Leave a Comment
Today we have even more instances of Islamophobia, both attacks and possible acts of terrorism. A man attacked some people at a restaurant after screaming about Islam and ISIS. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), and Mark Thompson, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A New York man was taken into custody for launching an attack on workers in a restaurant Monday night after demanding to know if they were Muslims, the New York Daily News is reporting.
In video obtained by the Daily News, Robert Murino, 26, can be seen reaching across the counter and punching a worker at the Salt & Pepper restaurant after calling the employee a “Muslim motherf*cker.”
According to court documents, Murino began by asking the employees — who hail from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh — how they felt about ISIS.
When staffer Tahir Mahood attempted to calm him down, the man reached across the counter and slapped him.
“I’ve been here for the last two years and nothing ever happened like this before, Mahood explained. “As a Muslim, I want to be polite, I don’t want to fight anyone.””*
