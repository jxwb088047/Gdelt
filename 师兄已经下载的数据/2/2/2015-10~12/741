Trey Gowdy’s Epic Benghazi Fail
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiOctober 25, 20151 Comment
The House Benghazi committee grilled Hillary Clinton for over eight hours yesterday, during which time they asked her over 300 questions. When Trey Gowdy was asked what was gained from the ordeal, he basically said nothing. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), and Mark Sovel (The Lip TV), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) couldn’t say Thursday night if his all-day Benghazi hearing with Hillary Clinton revealed any new information.
Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, was asked by reporters what new details came from his panel’s 11 hours of grilling the former secretary of state over her response to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.
“I think some of Jimmy Jordan’s questioning — well, when you say new today, we knew some of that already. We knew about the emails,” he said. “In terms of her testimony? I don’t know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous time she testified.””*
These jokers spent so much taxpayer money in their attempt to derail her political aspirations that THEY should be investigated and charged with fraud!
