Cenk Uygur rips CNN for giving GOP candidates a pass on mass shootings and right-wing terror
Of all the topics covered during Tuesday night’s GOP debate did not include some of the obvious and pressing ones facing the country on a daily basis, as pointed by a debate panel hosted by The Young Turks.
Of all the questions posed by CNN moderators, none were about right-wing terrorism, even though Robert Lewis Dear just killed three people and wounded nine at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs earlier this month.
“In the last 13 years, there’s been five times as many right-wing attacks in this country as Muslim attacks. Not a single question about it,” host Cenk Uygur said. He pointed out that while Republicans have been critical of Democratic candidates for not saying the phrase “radical Islam,” the GOP refuses to say “right wing terrorism.”
The panel, which included John Iadarola, Ben Mankiewicz, and Jimmy Dore also brought up mass shootings.
“If we’re having a debate about terror, can we also bring up the terrorism watch list and why they can buy weapons [on] the terrorism watch list?” Uygur said. “How do you not get a single question on that? …The mass shootings are right around the corner, in your neighborhood. That’s what’s making you less safe.”
Dore said it’s easier to scare voters when the perpetrators don’t look like them.
“It’s easier to scare people of the ‘other,’ someone who doesn’t look like you, especially if they’re darker,” he said.
