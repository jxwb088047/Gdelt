Donald Trump is in fact a good person who genuinely has America's interests at heart. He has exactly the skills and mindset we need to propel this country in the right direction. The media and the establishment has tried so hard to get a certain image of Donald Trump into our heads - the level of deceit and hate going around is a disgrace - but we know too well that image is false. Our last hope is Trump. Let's make America great again!

"Nobody really knows what Trump stands for, other than winning... and that is the real risk of a Trump presidency. We have no idea what this country will look like after we elect someone who cares more about his own ego than the laws of the land." ***Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=RubinReport

Meet the real Donald Trump - new bio reveals all
It's hard letting go of a trend or person that's been good to you, but honey, all good things come to an end! Check out who "The Real" ladies are tapping out, in this edition of Tap Out!
Donald Trump loves talking about what a great business man he is, and conservatives generally love to stress that they have single-handedly earned everything they have. Some new research on Donald Trump suggests otherwise. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"In an outstanding piece for National Journal, reporter S.V. Dáte notes that in 1974, the real estate empire of Trump's father, Fred, was worth about $200 million. Trump is one of five siblings, making his stake at that time worth about $40 million. If someone were to invest $40 million in a S&P 500 index in August 1974, reinvest all dividends, not cash out and have to pay capital gains, and pay nothing in investment fees, he'd wind up with about $3.4 billion come August 2015, according to Don't Quit Your Day Job's handy S&P calculator. If one factors in dividend taxes and a fee of 0.15 percent — which is triple Vanguard's actual fee for an exchange-traded S&P 500 fund — the total only falls to $2.3 billion.

It's hard to nail down Trump's precise net worth, but Bloomberg currently puts it at $2.9 billion, while Forbes puts it at $4 billion. So he's worth about as much as he would've been if he had taken $40 million from his dad and thrown it into an index fund.”*

This video will reveal to you the REAL reason why Donald Trump is running for president. There are many hidden agendas surrounding this election and many of us are completely unaware about the reality of them.
Donald Trump has proved that a presidential candidate does not need many of the attributes conventionally thought necessary to lead the pack in the Republican race for the White House, blithely offending Latinos, women and his fellow candidates, all the while rising in the polls. Now he has proved he considers foreign policy knowledge largely optional, too...

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing their problems,” he said. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some I assume are good people but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting.”

according to John R. O'Donnell’s book Trumped!: 
“Trump once said, in reference to a black accountant at Trump Plaza, ‘laziness is a trait in blacks.' He also told O’Donnell: ‘Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.’

“Well, you know, when it comes to racism and racists, I am the least racist person there is. And I think most people who know me would tell you that. I am the least racist, I’ve had great relationships. In fact, Randal Pinkett won, as you know, on The Apprentice a little while ago, a couple of years ago. And Randall’s been outstanding in every way. So I am the least racist person.”

In an interview with "Face the Nation's" John Dickerson, the comedian and host of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" talked presidential politics and Donald Trump, whose populism he admits he finds "very appealing."
There's many reasons to support Trump. 
He is the ONLY candidate who's not beholden to the 'money-men' or SuperPacs, and he funds his campaign himself. He is a great negotiator, businessman, and knows how to run a large organization. Trump cannot be 'bought' or bribed. The other candidates are just more of the same old thing, and they are beholden to people. Trump will fight harder for USA than any of the other candidates. 
Every week, more and more celebrities and regular people join in their support of Trump. The United States is in a downward spiral right now, and there are very few options available to stop it. The special-interests and Super-Pacs have a strangle-hold on America, and career politicians are inadvertently helping in our decline. 
I hope after seeing this, you will join us in attempting to get America back on-track, by supporting Donald Trump to be the next president. 
An opportunity like we have now does not come along very often, and we can actually have a president with no campaign obligations or favors owed. 
Or you can vote for the same old crap.
