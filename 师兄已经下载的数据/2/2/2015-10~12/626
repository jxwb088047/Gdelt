A 14-year-old North Texas boy will not face charges after he was suspended over a homemade clock that teachers, administrators and police found suspicious.

Ahmed Mohamed, who is Muslim, was arrested at MacArthur High School in Irving on Monday afternoon.

He said he enjoys tinkering with electronics and took the clock to school to show his engineering teacher. But an alarm on the clock went off in English class and his teacher confiscated it.

"I told them it's a clock. And they told me, 'Why would you bring a clock to school?' And I was like to tell time. And the officer said, 'There's clocks here, clocks here, clocks around you everywhere.' And I told him that I wanted to impress my teachers so that I could feel appreciated for it, but instead I got the police called on me," he said.

Police searched his belongings and removed him from school in handcuffs.

Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said Mohamed originally was not very forthcoming and the school was concerned that the device was possibly the infrastructure for a bomb. Officers acted in an abundance of caution.

“It was a very suspicious device. We live in an age where you can't take things like that to school. Of course we've seen across our country horrific things happen. We have to err on the side of caution," Boyd said.

In the state of Texas a person can be found guilty of possessing a hoax bomb if the device is intended to bring fear. But, police no longer believe Mohamed’s device is dangerous and he will not be charged.

"We found no evidence to support the perception that he intended to create alarm," Boyd said.

Ahmed Mohamed's homemade clock first drew police, then later an invitation to the White House by President Obama himself. You see, teachers and school officials in Texas assumed the clock was a bomb and actually arrested the high school freshman. Luckily, Twitter and what seems like most of the world have come to Ahmed's defense. Tell us in the comments, what are some examples of racial bias you've seen at your school? #ADD #TheDrop

LBN’s Emily Collins reports that a 14-year-old Texas schoolboy was arrested today for bringing a homemade digital clock to school. Some school officials thought it might be a bomb. #IStandWithAhmed has swept the social media, and Muslim profiling is alleged.
Ahmed Mohamed, 14, arrested over clock mistaken for bomb - Muslim 14-year-old ARRESTED after teachers claimed the alarm clock he made for engineering class 'looked like a bomb'

A Muslim teenager was arrested and led in handcuffs after bringing in his home-made clock into school after teachers claimed the invention 'looked like a bomb'. 

Ahmed Mohamed, 14, from Irving, Texas, created the device and brought it into school to show his engineering teacher. 

The student said he enjoys electronics and works on many inventions. 

The youngster took his clock into MacArthur High School in Irving. 

He told the Dallas Morning News that he built the clock on Sunday in his bedroom in about 20 minutes, using a circuit board, a digital display and several wires. He enclosed the device into a pencil case with a tiger hologram on the front. 

Ahmed said he first showed his invention to his engineering teacher, who gave him some advice. 

'He was like, "That's really nice. I would advise you not to show that to other teachers."'

He kept the clock in his bag, but it started to beep later in the day during an English class. He showed his clock to the teacher who said it looked like a bomb.

Muslim Student, Ahmed Mohamed, Arrested After Homemade Clock Was Mistaken For Bomb

He said his engineering teacher had congratulated him but advised him "not to show any other teachers".
In the case of Ahmed Mohamed, the muslim student arrested for bringing a clock to school, we here at TYT told you conservatives would start attacking him. Cue Sarah Palin… Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said on Saturday that arresting and suspending Ahmed Mohamed, the ninth grader who brought a homemade clock to school, was totally reasonable.

Palin called initial media reports of Mohamed's arrest "fishy" and said that school officials were totally justified in thinking that his clock, made out of a pencil box, was a bomb.

"Yep, believing that's a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history," she wrote in a Facebook post in which she shared pictures of her kids' pencil boxes. "Right. That's a clock, and I'm the Queen of England.””*

IRVING, TEXAS — The story of Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year old Texas kid who was arrested after his teachers mistook a clock he made for a science project for a bomb, turned out to have a happy ending after the circumstances of his arrest struck a chord with people across America.

News of Ahmed's Monday arrest caused an uproar on social media, with the hashtag "I stand with Ahmed" quickly building up a head of steam.

Twitter users poked fun at the ridiculous nature of Ahmed's arrest, while others posted messages of support and recalled similar incidents from their youth that exposed the seeming double standard applied in Ahmed's case. 
 
The Twitter firestorm stemmed from the perceived racism and ignorance displayed by both teachers and Irving police that lead to Ahmed's detention, and although he was later released without charge, Ahmed's story became the latest example of spooked authorities being far too cautious while ignoring the evidence present.

Ahmed's case attracted so much attention, then he briefly became a topic at the latest GOP debate, with candidates asked about the difference between vigilance and discrimination.

Ahmed also scored an invite to Facebook from Mark Zuckerberg, plus other invites to NASA labs and his dream school MIT.

The incident eventually even caught the attention of President Barack Obama, who Tweeted out an invite to Ahmed, asking him to bring his clock to an Astronomy Night event at the White House on October 19.
