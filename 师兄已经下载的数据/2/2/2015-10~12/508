Xinjiang official accuses colleagues over terrorism | gbtimes.com
A top official in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has lashed out at colleagues for “being of two minds” over the region's counter-terrorism campaign.
Xu Hairong, Secretary of Discipline Inspection Commission in Xinjiang, claimed in an article published by a newspaper run by China's Ministry of Supervision on Tuesday that some cadres supported and even participated in terror activities.
The statement came after local state-run media reports that police had killed 28 "thugs" responsible for a coal mine assault in September. Foreign media have long criticised Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang, home to more than nine million Muslim Uyghurs, saying it has suppressed the minority group under the pretence of counter-terrorism.
A BBC report claims it is unclear why the Chinese government waited so long to confirm that the coal mine incident took place but the timing will raise questions, particularly because the first details of the extraordinary police response emerged on Saturday, the day after the Paris attacks.
