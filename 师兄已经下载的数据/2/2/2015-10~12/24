Were the lungs the seat of wisdom, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly would be wise, but they are not and he is not. So it is not astonishing that he is doubling down on his wager that the truth cannot catch up with him. It has, however, already done so. The prolific O'Reilly has, with his collaborator Martin Dugard, produced five "history" books in five years: Killing Lincoln,...
A particularly intolerable meme continues to play out in the news media and online: Apparently U.S. history began on January 20, 2009, when Barack Obama was inaugurated. In case you were unaware, President Obama is evidently the first president to take vacations; he's the first president to play golf; he's the first president to be photographed without a suit or tie; and he's...

Earlier this month, premier Fox newsman Bill O’Reilly became unhinged on live television. A red-faced O’Reilly loudly and repeatedly called his invited guest, Washington Post columnist and fellow conservative Fox News journalist George Will, a “hack” and accused him of lying. It was a surreal moment, with stunned viewers no doubt muttering to themselves, “Is the jig finally...
Fox News host and bestselling author Bill O’Reilly joined Breitbart News Sunday and discussed his fifth book on American history, Killing Reagan: The Violent Assault that Changed the Presidency.

More Fox News infighting. Bill O’Reilly has written a book about Reagan that George Will doesn’t find flattering enough. O\'Reilly invited him on the show to hash it out. It took little time for these two liars and hacks to start calling each other liars and hacks. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"FOX News\' Bill O\'Reilly has a heated argument with network contributor George Will over his latest column which accuses the O\'Reilly Factor host of slandering former President Ronald Reagan in his latest book, Killing Reagan.

\"It is not a laudatory book,\" Will said about O\'Reilly\'s Killing Reagan. \"It is doing the work of the left which knows in order to discredit conservatism it must destroy Reagan\'s reputation as president. Your book does the work of the American left with its extreme recklessness.\"

\"You\'re a hack,\" O\'Reilly said to Will. \"You are in with the cabal of the Reagan loyalists who don\'t want the truth to be told.””*

Bill O\'Reilly\'s latest book was recently attacked by a fellow Fox News associate, George Will and so Bill brought him onto his show to do nothing but yell at him. The Infowars Nightly News crew break down how both sides of this argument are nothing but establishment hacks.
