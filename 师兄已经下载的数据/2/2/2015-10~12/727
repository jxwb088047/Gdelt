China's four senior judicial and public security officials, accompanied by the Region's Party secretary, have attended an anti-terror conference in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The region's leading newspaper, Xinjiang Daily, has run three consecutive front-page stories about their visit. According to its reports, the officials have also visited the local judicial and public security organs, and met with local police officers.
The recent terror attack in Paris -- as well as the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California -- have raised global concerns about public security and anti-terrorism.
