Cultural center in Madrid opens Xinjiang Cultural Week - China.org.cn
The Chinese cultural center in Madrid was the site of the inauguration of the 2015 Xinjiang Week of Culture on Wednesday evening.
A delegation from Xinjiang of the far northwest China gave a demonstration of traditional dances and songs from the region.
Xu Ruijun, a cultural official with the local government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, told Xinhua that the most important part of Xinjiang was its culture.
"The fact this land has many different ethnic groups has given us a multifaceted culture with surprising diversity. It is a pleasure for me to have been able to bring a demonstration of this diverse and charming culture to Spain," he said.
For those unfamiliar with the region of Xinjiang, there was also a stunning display of photos, which highlight the diversity of the region which covers over 1.6 million square km.
Xinjiang is an area of contrasts and its landscape ranges from deserts which are baking hot in the summer, to mountainous regions, where the temperatures can drop below minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter.
It is also a region of ethnic and religious diversity, all of which is reflected in the wealth of its culture, which people in Madrid will be able to enjoy for the coming week, according to officials.
