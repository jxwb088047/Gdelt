Jeb Bush's Anti-Rubio Ad Campaign Dead On Arrival
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 10, 2015Leave a Comment
Jeb Bush has lined up a twenty million dollar ad campaign against Marco Rubio. If it doesn’t work, Jeb’s campaign is likely sunk. It probably won’t work. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The Times reported that Right to Rise is willing to spend $20 million on an effort to defeat Rubio. The Super PAC held focus groups with New Hampshire voters in October, the results of which suggest that attacks highlighting Rubio’s missed votes on Planned Parenthood funding and the Iran nuclear deal could hurt the senator in the primary, according to the Times.
The Rubio campaign also used the New York Times report in a Monday night fundraising email.
“And they’re bragging about that? How is that the kind of ‘joyful’ campaign that Jeb claimed he wanted to run?!?!” Rubio campaign manager Terry Sullivan wrote in a fundraising email, referencing Bush’s previous comments that he was running for president “joyfully,” according to the Washington Post.”*
