NEW YORK CITY — Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. 

\"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\'s representatives can figure out what is going on,\" a campaign press release said. 

Trump, who has previously called for surveillance against mosques and said he was also game to setting up a database for all Muslims living in the U.S., made his comments in the wake of the San Bernardino mass shooting, and a day after President Barack Obama\'s Oval Office address. 

\"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,\" the real estate mogul said in a statement. \"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.\" 

Trump\'s ban would not only apply to Muslims planning to immigrate to the U.S., but also to Muslim tourists. Trump did say Muslims currently living in the U.S. are okay though.

Presidential candidates from the right and left quickly denounced Trump\'s comments. But will it be enough to take down Trump, who is still destroying the rest of the GOP field in the polls?

If you had held out any hope that Donald Trump had some line that he wouldn’t cross in demonizing muslims, prepare to disappointed. He keeps doing his best to raise the bar of madness and fascism. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been spouting increasingly fascist ideas for months, but in an interview published today by Yahoo he crossed what must be some kind of rubicon toward actual Nazism and not just the implication of it. When asked by Yahoo whether he\'d track Muslims in the US by \"registering [them] in a database or giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion,\" Trump didn\'t rule those obviously insane ideas out. \"We\'re going to have to — we\'re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,\" Trump told Yahoo. \"We\'re going to have to look at the mosques. We\'re going to have to look very, very carefully.””*

Since Donald Trump has gone over the top and said he would ban all muslims from entering the country (including returning citizens and veterans), people have begun calling him out on it. Various outlets made Hitler comparisons. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Donald J. Trump called on Monday for the United States to bar all Muslims from entering the country until the nation’s leaders can “figure out what is going on” after the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric aimed at voters’ fears about members of the Islamic faith.

A prohibition of Muslims – an unprecedented proposal by a leading American presidential candidate, and an idea more typically associated with hate groups – reflects a progression of mistrust that is rooted in ideology as much as politics.

Mr. Trump, who in September declared “I love the Muslims,” turned sharply against them after the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for a database to track Muslims in America and repeating discredited rumors that thousands of Muslims celebrated in New Jersey on 9/11. His poll numbers rose largely as a result, until a setback in Iowa on Monday morning. Hours later Mr. Trump called for the ban, fitting his pattern of making stunning comments when his lead in the Republican presidential field appears in jeopardy.”*
