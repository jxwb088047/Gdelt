Cop Points Gun At Black Man’s Head « InvestmentWatch
Cell phone video of a police officer putting his gun to the head of a man he was pulling over has, against all odds, actually resulted in a conviction of the officer. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“William Cunningham and Kennieth Smith were doing nothing wrong, had committed no crime, and were attempting to go about their daily routine when they were nearly killed by a power tripping cop.
On Wednesday, that power tripping cop, Prince George’s County Police officer Jenchesky Santiago, was remarkably found guilty for 1st and 2nd-degree assault, use of a firearm in violence, and misconduct in office – only after cellphone footage survived and was given to prosecutors.
The video remained private until the PGPD police department released it this week. What it shows is nothing short of a lunatic on a rampage threatening innocent people with his gun.
On May 10, 2014, Cunningham and Smith were sitting in a vehicle outside Cunningham’s home as Smith was dropping off his cousin. At this point, Santiago approached the vehicle and told them they were parked illegally, according to prosecutors.”*
