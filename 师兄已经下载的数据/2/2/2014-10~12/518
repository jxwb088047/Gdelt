Critics are angry that it seems disrespectful to the students who died there protesting the Chinese government, in 1989. Cenk Uygur, Hannah Cranston (ThinkTank), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show), hosts of The Young Turks discuss.

Do you see anything wrong with Zuckerberg’s run? Let us know in the comments below.

“A photo of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg jogging Friday morning in downtown Beijing\'s notorious smog has prompted a torrent of amusing comments and some mockery on Chinese social media.

Zuckerberg is a favorite personality among the Chinese public, despite Facebook being banned in the country alongside other overseas social media platforms. He\'s also become somewhat notorious for persistent yet so far futile efforts to woo leaders enforcing China\'s strict online censorship.

The young tech tycoon is in Beijing to attend an economic forum over the weekend, when some of the world\'s business and finances leaders will rub shoulders with senior Chinese politicians.”

Theme song for the 100-day countdown celebration of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, music by Xiao Ke and original lyrics by Lam Jik (Hong Kong).

The melody of the song was inspired by a local Beijing ballad called \"Shui Niu\", which are snails that come out on rainy days. Children in Beijing like to sing songs to attract these little creatures to come out of their shells. 

For those of you wondering where\'s Andy Lau, he has his own Olympic song: \"Everbody Is No.1\"

For those of you wondering where\'s Jay Chou, he has his own Olympic song: \"千山万水\"

For those of you wondering where\'s S.H.E, Jacky Cheung and Wilber Pan, they have their own Olympic song: \"红遍全球\"

Lyrics:
Chen Tianjia: Welcoming another dawn, bringing fresh new air

Liu Huan: The air changes, but sentiment still scents of fragrant tea

Na Ying: The doors of my home open wide, awaiting you with open arms

Stefanie Sun (Singapore): After an embrace there will be understanding, you will love this place

Sun Yue: From far or near you\'re all our guests, please don\'t be shy

Wang Leehom (Taiwan): We\'ve promised to get together, we welcome you

Han Hong: We\'ve planted evergreens, blooming every legend

Chau Wakin (Hong Kong): We\'ve sown the ancient earth, for memories to be cherished

Gigi Leung (Hong Kong): Strangers or friends you\'re all our guests, please be at home

Yuquan: No matter how many times you\'ve been here, we\'ve much to talk about

Jackie Chan (Hong Kong): Beijing welcomes you
We\'ve opened our world for you

Richie Ren (Taiwan): Its charming tides of change teems with life
