The Uyghur language, formerly known as Eastern Turki, is a Turkic language with 8 to 11 million speakers, spoken primarily by the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China. Significant communities of Uyghur-speakers are located in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Uyghur is an official language of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

The term \"East Turkestan\" is inextricably linked with politics. In general, most of the toponyms for places in Central Asia do not reflect the region\'s diversity. The history of Xinjiang in particular is contested between the government of China and Uyghur separatists, as is which name to use \"Xinjiang\" or \"Uyghur Autonomous Region\" or \"East Turkestan\" or \"Shinjang\"(derived from the Uyghur pronunciation of Xinjiang). In modern separatist usage. \"Uyghurstan\", which means \"land of the Uyghurs\", is a synonym for Xinjiang or a potential state in Xinjiang. However there is no consensus among separatists about whether to use \"East Turkestan\" or \"Uyghurstan\"....

Sixty years after Xinjiang became an autonomous region under the People’s Republic of China, we take a look back and try to unravel its rich cultural heritage, the move towards modernism, and the fact that the region’s GDP has increased over a hundred fold since 1955. We also discuss the ethnic and political problems the region has seen with Professor Wang Hui from the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University.

China says an international terror group is behind violence in its far western Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and is calling for international help to tackle a common foe.


The state-controlled Global Times reported on an organization called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which it said is trying to create an independent state. The group, it said, has been recruiting ethnic Uyghurs while abroad in Turkey, sending them to gain combat experience fighting against the government in Syria, and then sending them back to commit terror attacks in their home region. 

At the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Spokeswoman Hua Chunying has called for international cooperation: 

China\'s claims of an international terror group are being made alongside vows to crack down in Xinjiang, following the worst ethnic violence seen there between indigenous Uyghurs and Han Chinese in 4 years. 

According to state media, 35 people were killed last Wednesday in an attack on government buildings in a remote Xinjiang township, and two days later more than 100 people riding motorbikes and wielding knives staged another attack on a police station in the city of Hotan. 

Blaming outside forces bent on breaking up China has been Beijing\'s consistent reaction to violence in Xinjiang. Ordinary citizens there, it says, are happy with the benefits of its benevolent rule and massive investments that have developed the local economy. 

Critics, however, say the government is enacting a policy of colonization, involving the repression of indigenous Uyghurs as they are dispossessed of their culture and land.

Eleven people were killed and two were injured on Saturday in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, after a group of people armed with axes and knives attacked a police station.

According to reports, the assault took place at about 5:30 p.m. in Selibuya township.

Nine mobs holding knives and axes attacked the station and killed two officers. Police gunned all of them down immediately after, Reuters reported. 

One of the attackers was identified with an apparent Uighur name, a web report from the Xinjiang government stated. 

According to Xinhua, another two policemen were injured in the attack.

Police said that after the armed men were killed social order returned to normal.

Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based advocacy group, said however that the Uighurs were protesting and that armed Chinese personnel were to blame for the violence, AFP reported. 

He said in an email that besides the deaths, \"several tens\" of Uighur demonstrators were arrested.

\"I again call on international society to take emergency measures to stop the Chinese government from directly opening fire to suppress Uighur protesters and depriving them of using legal appeals and defending their rights,\" he added, according to AFP. 

The reported incident comes at a time of heightened tensions following an attack in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square that the government blamed on \"terrorists\" from Xinjiang.

Xinjiang (XUAR) (Uyghur: شىنجاڭ‎, ULY: Shinjang; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕíntɕjɑ́ŋ]; Chinese: 新疆; pinyin: Xīnjiāng; Wade–Giles: Hsin1-chiang1; Postal map spelling: Sinkiang) is an autonomous region (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) of the People's Republic of China. It is the largest Chinese administrative division and spans over 1.6 million km2. Xinjiang borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing region.
It is home to a number of different ethnic groups including the Uyghur, Han, Kazakh, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Mongol. More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are located in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan, Sinkiang, and East Turkestan. Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.
