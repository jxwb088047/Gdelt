300 Chinese Nationals Join Islamic State | News | teleSUR English
Around 300 Chinese are fighting with Islamic State group, the extremist Islamist movement in Syria and Iraq, Global Times, a Chinese state newspaper reported Monday and drawing from various sources. 
 
 
 
 
 

The newspaper reported that the 300 included security officers from Iraq's Kurdish region, Syria and Lebanon. 
 
 
 
 
 

According to Sputnik News, fighters from China and other Asian countries have been arriving to Iraq and Syria through Turkey, and Turkey has been issuing the fighters Turkish passports. 
 
 
 
 
 

A source said to the Global Times, "The fact that these extremists can easily enter Turkey and later travel to Syria and Iraq to join IS is a direct consequence of the Turkish government's ambiguous policies." 
 
 
 
 
 

The Global Times went on to say that members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) from China have been traveling through Turkey to Syria to join the Islamic State group. 
 
 
 
 
 

Chinese authorities have been accusing the ETIM of carrying out assaults in Xinjiang, the autonomous region in the far west of China, home to the Muslim Uighurs. 
 
 
 
 
 

Earlier this year, China's envoy to the Middle East, Wu Sike, had said that there were about 100 Chinese nationals fighting or being trained in the Middle East. 
 
 
 
 
 

In the past year, Chinese authorities have launched “a year-long campaign against terrorism,” in the region.
