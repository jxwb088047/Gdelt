Protesters ‘welcome’ Xi to Canberra | TODAYonline
Hundreds of protesters and dozens of supporters gathered outside as President Xi Jinping became the second Chinese leader to address Australia’s Parliament yesterday.
Pro-Beijing supporters wearing red and waving China flags were on the lawn in front of Parliament House, separated by barricades from protesters chanting “Xi Jinping not welcome” and “Down with China”.
Ethnic groups protesting against alleged human rights abuses against minority Uighurs and Tibetans joined the throng; a banner read “Australia’s Real and Biggest Threat: China’s Expansionism”.
Dressed as a Chinese soldier wielding a plastic baton and with pockets stuffed with fake yuan notes symbolising government corruption, Mr Charlie Ni said he had travelled from Sydney to protest against Mr Xi’s visit and the persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual movement.
“Xi can hear our voice, we are sending a message,” said Mr Ni, 51, who has lived in Sydney for 15 years. “We all want to end the persecutions by China. We want a free China.”
On the other side of the barricades, Canberra-based university student Chang Liu held a Chinese flag and said he was proud Mr Xi was in Australia.
“Our life is much better in China now,” the 29-year-old said. “The government is not perfect, but the protesters aren’t being constructive.” BLOOMBERG
