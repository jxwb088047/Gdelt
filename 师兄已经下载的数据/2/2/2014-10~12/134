 [Magharebia]Algiers -Confronting extremist groups requires more than drying up their supply chains and money sources, Maghreb religious officials warn. Defeating terrorists also involves drying up their sources of thought.

Description:
When it comes to religion, people are constantly seeking answers to life such as what our purpose in life is, why bad things happen, and coping with day-to-day life. Our human nature causes us to yearn for a place to belong. Usually this yearning will result in social groups, joining a church, or some sort of club. While there is nothing wrong with wanting a place to belong, sometimes the desperation of gullible people result in them joining a cult and engaging in religious practices that are not only crazy, but could very well be breaking the law.
But when we look at the facts, almost every religion has something weird going on. This isn’t exclusive to cults. Mainstream Christianity has some weird elements such as the act of communion. Sure, drinking wine and eating wafers seems innocent enough. But when you look at what the food and drink represent, being the body and blood of Jesus Christ, we start to lose our appetites. In a way, are churches committing some sort of spiritual cannibalism? Drinking the blood of Christ for spiritual purity sounds awfully similar to vampirism.
There is a plethora of creepy religions out there that don’t even cause physical harm, such as Spiritualism, which became extraordinarily popular in the 19th century. Part of that was thanks to the Civ...

Life Inside A Religious Cult - Secrets Of Cult Documentary Exposed - HD Documentary

A cult is a spiritual or social team with socially deviant or novel beliefs as well as techniques. [1] However, whether any kind of certain team\'s ideas and also techniques are adequately deviant or novel is commonly unclear, therefore making an exact interpretation troublesome. [2] [3] In the English speaking globe, the word often brings derogatory connotations. [4] [5] The word \"cult\" has consistently been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, utilized as an ad hominem strike against teams with differing doctrines or methods, which lacks a clear or constant definition.

Starting in the 1930s, cults ended up being the item of sociological study in the context of the research study of spiritual behavior. [8] Specific groups have been labelled as cults and have actually been opposed by the Christian countercult movement for their unorthodox beliefs. Since the 1970s, some groups have been opposed by the anti-cult movement, partly motivated in reaction to acts of physical violence committed by members of some groups. Some of the beliefs by the anti-cult movement have actually been disputed by other scholars and by the news media, leading to further debate. Public and governmental responses to the cult concern have also been a source of controversy.

The word \"cult\" was originally used not to explain a team of religionists, but also for the act of worship or religious ceremony. It wased initially utilized in the early 17th century, borrowed via the Fr...

Religion is a collection of cultural systems, belief systems, and worldviews that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.
The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system, but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect[citation needed]. Many religions have organized behaviors, clergy, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregations of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural), and/or scriptures. The practice of a religion may also include sermons, commemoration of the activities of a god or gods, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trance, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. However, there are examples of religions for which some or many of these aspects of structure, belief, or practices are absent.
