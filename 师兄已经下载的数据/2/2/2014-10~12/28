In June 2014, ISIS fighters swept across the Syrian border and tore into Iraq. The militant wave seemed unstoppable, until they reached the border of Kurdistan-a homeland of a fierce and forgotten people. Today, ISIS controls over a third of Iraq-but the Kurds have united like never before to defend their home. Who are the Kurds and the people who hold the line against ISIS?

With ISIS all over the news, it\'s easy to forget that there are many more groups in Iraq fighting for control. One of these groups of people are the Kurds and they\'re starting to become a force to be reckoned with. Who are they and what do they want in Iraq?

For over a year Kurdish forces have united in defence against bloody IS attacks. So how have Islamic State still managed to recruit hundreds of young Kurds to fight for the Caliphate against their own families?

\"There are Kurdish families in Halabja whose sons are in IS and their hearts are broken, but I\'ll never go to their funerals\", says the grieving mother of Kaihan Borhan, a Kurd who died fighting with the Peshmarga against IS. Her family is distraught that the people responsible for his death could well be Kurdish nationals. \"I have a friend whose brother died fighting for ISIS\", says Kaihan\'s brother. \"I never grieved for him and my friend cannot bear to look me in the eye.\" In this report we see the path to extremism that many Kurds have taken.

An explosion believed to have been caused by a suicide bomber has hit the popular Istiklal Street in central Istanbul\'s Taksim square area. Government officials said at least five people were killed and 36 were injured - seven seriously - in Saturday morning\'s explosion. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that at least two Israeli nationals were killed in the blast, while a third may have died. Two American nationals have also been killed while Iran said that one of its citizens had also died. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the blast was \"inhumane\" and would not stop Turkey, which has been targeted by Kurdish rebels. Tyranny Unmasked gives his opinions.

LAVROV CALLS ON US TO INFLUENCE TURKEY ON ISSUE OF INCLUDING KURDS IN INTER-SYRIAN TALKS - 11 Mar - Non-participation of Kurds in inter-Syrian talks will feed their thoughts on separation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday.
\"Kurds, including the Democratic Union (party) headed by Salih Muslim, control, in accordance with common estimates, at least 15% of the territory where they live in peaceful times,\" Lavrov said. \"Now, when Kurds have become allies to the US-led coalition and Russia in the fight against Islamic State and Jebhat al-Nusra (terrorist organizations banned in Russia), they (Kurds) have strengthened their influence ‘on the ground’, their positions,\" he added.
\"Starting talks without this group is a demonstration of weakness of the international community,\" the foreign minister went on. \"Only Turkey blocks inviting Kurds - the only country that hopes to continue using only ultimatums in the future not only on Syria but also in the dialogue with EU. Other participants of Syria Support Group speak clearly for the importance of including Kurds from the very start of the negotiations process,\" he said.

A tenuous peace has been reached between the two, enabling a semblance of normal life in the south of the city. But evidence of the recent fighting remains a constant presence.

Syria has been at war now for five years. And in that time, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party or PYD, and its armed wing the YPG, have skillfully gained control of almost the entire northern stretch of the country. An area the Kurds call Rojava.Aided by US material support and air-strikes, they are seen as a key ally in the fight against ISIL.But the Kurds of Syria have been frustrated, as their victories on the battlefield have not translated into political gains.Shut out of UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva, they have chosen to go it alone.Declaring their intention to establish a federal Kurdish region in northern Syria.The Kurds say they are not pushing for independence. Rather, for a decentralised, federal model to be applied throughout Syria.But their plan is running into major resistance.Not just from Turkey, which has threatened to go to war if necessary, to block the creation of any autonomous Kurdish region in Syria, but also from the bulk of the Syrian opposition and the government in Damascus.On this Inside Story, we ask if federalism could work in Syria? And how will Kurdish demands affect negotiations to end the war?Presenter: Nick ClarkGuests:Peter Galbraith - Former US Diplomat and informal Adviser to Syrian KurdsMuhittin Ataman - Deputy General Coordinator, SETALydia Wilson - Research Fellow, Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, Oxford University...

And in that time, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party or PYD, and its armed wing the YPG, have skillfully gained control of almost the entire northern stretch of the country. An area the Kurds call Rojava.Aided by US material support and air-strikes, they are seen as a key ally in the fight against ISIL.But the Kurds of Syria have been frustrated, as their victories on the battlefield have not translated into political gains.Shut out of UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva, they have chosen to go it alone.Declaring their intention to establish a federal Kurdish region in northern Syria.The Kurds say they are not pushing for independence. Rather, for a decentralised, federal model to be applied throughout Syria.But their plan is running into major resistance.Not just from Turkey, which has threatened to go to war if necessary, to block the creation of any autonomous Kurdish region in Syria, but also from the bulk of the Syrian opposition and the government in Damascus.On this Inside Story, we ask if federalism could work in Syria? And how will Kurdish demands affect negotiations to end the war?Presenter: Nick ClarkGuests:Peter Galbraith - Former US Diplomat and informal Adviser to Syrian KurdsMuhittin Ataman - Deputy General Coordinator, SETALydia Wilson - Research Fellow, Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, Oxford University...
The Kurdish people, or Kurds (Kurdish: کورد Kurd), are an Iranic people native to the Middle East, mostly inhabiting a region known as Kurdistan, which includes adjacent parts of Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. They speak the Kurdish language, which is a member of the Iranian branch of Indo-European languages. The Kurds number about 30 million, the majority living in the Middle East, with significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey, in Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Azerbaijan, Russia, Lebanon and, in recent decades, some European countries and the United States. The Kurds are an indigenous ethnic minority in countries where the Kurdistan region is located, although they have enjoyed partial autonomy in Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991. An irredentist movement pushes for the creation of a Kurdish nation state.
The exact origins of the name, "Kurd", are unclear. Reynolds believes that the term Kurd is most likely related to the ancient term Qardu. The common root of Kurd and Qardu is first mentioned in a Sumerian tablet from the third millennium B.C. as the "land of Kar-da." Qardu is etymologically related to the Assyrian term Urartu corresponding to Ararat. According to Asatrian, the most reasonable explanation of this ethnonym is its possible connections with the Cyrtii (Cyrtaei)
