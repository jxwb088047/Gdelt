Chinese Media Say 15 Killed In ‘Terrorist Attack’ In Xinjiang
Xinjiang is frequently hit by unrest sparked by fierce tensions between China’s ethnic Han majority and the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs, with authorities regularly blaming Uighur militants for the violence. — Reuters pic BEIJING: Fifteen people have been killed and 14 others wounded in a “terrorist attack” in China’s mostly Muslim Xinjiang region, the official Chinese news agency said today.
A group of “terrorists” launched an attack on civilians yesterday in Shache county, leaving four people dead and 14 wounded. Eleven “terrorists” were also shot dead during the violence, according to CCTV, China’s state broadcaster.
Chinese state news agency Xinhua confirmed the death toll, citing a statement from local authorities.
The district of Shache — or Yarkand in the Uighur language — was the scene of violent clashes in July, shortly before the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
Xinjiang is frequently hit by unrest sparked by fierce tensions between China’s ethnic Han majority and the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs, with authorities regularly blaming Uighur militants for the violence.
Some Uighurs in the north west Chinese region are hostile to Beijing’s leadership.
They say they are victims of discrimination and left out of the benefits of development in Xinjiang, which has seen an influx of Han Chinese moving in from elsewhere in the country.
Experts and human rights activists say that repressive policies regarding religion and culture adopted by Beijing fuel the tensions in the region.
