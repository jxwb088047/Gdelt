22 dead in attack on Han Chinese market in Xinjiang, report says | The Japan Times
BEIJING – Four Uighur men armed with knives and explosives attacked a marketplace in northwestern China’s Xinjiang region on Oct. 12, leaving 22 people dead, including police officers, Radio Free Asia said Sunday. The attackers were among the dead.
It quoted police as saying the attack occurred at an ethnic Han Chinese farmers’ market in Bachu County.
The four Uighurs stabbed an unknown number of police officers as they stormed into the market on two motorcycles, hurling explosives and attacking Han Chinese stall owners before they were gunned down by security personnel, the radio network said.
It quoted a police officer as saying dozens of people were injured. It said the death toll included police officers.
Leave Uighurs alone, and be at peace. Hans should move back to rest of the China and allow Uighurs to own free business, jobs and other basic opportunities.
