A court in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has sentenced 12 people to death for organizing terrorist attacks that killed 37 civilians in Shache County on July the 28th. 15 others were also sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve by the Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court of Kashgar Prefecture. CCTV spoke with the defendants and police involved in the case. And that has revealed more details of the tragedy.
The tragedy took place in the early morning in a local township in Shache county.
A local government official reported to the police that he saw a suspicious gathering.
"After receiving the report, we immediately went to the scene. And we saw a group of people gathering there. We checked their IDs and brought them back to the station for further investigation," A police officer said.
During the investigation, rumors started to spread in the township and nearby villages.
And a gang of unidentified men showed up in the villages.
"We heard that the police had killed some women who were attending the sermon," A 7/28 attack defendant said.
"Some were shouting to start a holy war," A 7/28 attack defendant said.
When the villagers came out and tried to stop them, the gang members, who were armed with knives and axes, attacked a police station and government offices in Elixku Township. Some moved on to the nearby Huangdi Township, attacking civilians and smashing vehicles as they passed.
Dozens of Uygur and Han civilians were killed or injured. Police say some of the gang had joined the terrorist group due to religious extremism.
Some have showed regret. They say they hope their mistakes can serve as a lesson.
"I hope those people who are trying to lead others to crime, could think about public safety and do not violate the law. Also, not let their parents and children repeat the tragedy that we have brought to those people," A 7/28 attack defendant said.
