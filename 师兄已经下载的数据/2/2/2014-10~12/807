Trade with China’s autonomous region shows upward trend
URUMUQIPakistan’s trade with China’s Xinjiang region is continuously showing an upward trend as its annual trade has reached around $147 million in the recent year, said a senior official of the Xinjiang Commerce Department.It was the result of the encouraging policy of the Central Government that wishes greater economic cooperation between Pakistan and its Western region. In the year 2013, Xinjiang exported products to Pakistan, worth $133.15 million, while its imports were $14.01 million. The export to Pakistan included textiles, garments, footwear, diesel-powered machinery components, transformers, small appliances and toys, while the imports were dried fruits, carpets, walnuts, linters, blades and yarns.The official told a media seminar here, that they are focusing on early construction of rail link between the two sides to further enhance there economic interaction and the volume of trade. They are also pushing for upgrading of Karakorum highway.” We will also try to increase direct air routes from Urumqi and Kashgar to Pakistan.  To a question, the official said the backward infrastructure of most of countries bordering Xinjiang has resulted in poor performance and inefficiency in custom clearance, thus impeding the developing of bilateral trade. He proposed that Pakistan’s major trading companies should set up their business offices in Urumqi to explore new avenues of bilateral trade. “We are ready to extend necessary facilities and incentives for this purpose,” he added.
