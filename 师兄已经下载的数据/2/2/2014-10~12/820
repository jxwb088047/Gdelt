In photos: I am from Xinjiang[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn
Photographer Kurbanjan has been touring the country since March, recording the daily lives of more than 100 Xinjiang people working in 20 Chinese cities.
"When people leave Xinjiang for other Chinese cities, they become a ‘real minority’ because they have a different appearance, they speak different languages and they have a distinctive lifestyle and religion." Kurbanjan wrote.
The photographer hopes his photo stories give the Han people a better understanding of people from Xinjiang. "They are just like you and me, who are striving for a better life". [Photo/qq.com]
