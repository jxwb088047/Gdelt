The Chinese government has released a white paper detailing the history and achievements of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, or XPCC. It marks the 60th anniversary of the XPCC, which is a semi-military organization that carried out governmental functions in the Xinjiang region in northwestern China. The white paper highlights the XPCC’s role in maintaining social stability and enhancing border defense. Statistics show the total output value of the XPCC in 2013 was nearly 150 billion yuan, about 24 billion US dollars. That’s about 220 times that of 1954 when it was established. The white paper says the XPCC has made "indelible contributions" to the development of Xinjiang by promoting unity among ethnic groups, maintaining social stability, and strengthening national border defense.
