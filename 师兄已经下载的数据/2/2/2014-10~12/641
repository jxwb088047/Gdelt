WATCH LIVE: Sam Harris and Cenk Uygur debate whether Islam is a religion of violence
Following up on the debate that exploded between Real Time host Bill Maher and actor Ben Affleck earlier this month, neuroscientist Sam Harris will appear on The Young Turks to discuss his controversial statements about Islam with host Cenk Uygur.
Harris, an outspoken atheist, has been labelled an “Islamophobe” for saying that vast numbers of Muslims accept dangerous religious doctrines. Uygur has said that he agrees with Harris’s views on religion in general, but disagrees with his characterization of Muslims as violent.
