'Terrorist attack' in Xinjiang takes lives of 15: state media - The China Post
A group of "terrorists" launched an attack on civilians Friday in Shache county, leaving four people dead and 14 wounded. Eleven "terrorists" were also shot dead during the violence, according to CCTV, China's state broadcaster.
Chinese state news agency Xinhua confirmed the death toll, citing a statement from local authorities.
At around 1.30 p.m. (0530 GMT) on Friday men armed with knives threw explosive devices and attacked crowds on commercial street, Xinhua reported.
Eleven of the attackers were killed by police who were patrolling in the area. Explosives, knives and axes were seized at the scene.
The wounded were evacuated and taken to hospital, the news agency said.
Situated 200 kilometers from the regional capital of Kashgar, the district of Shache — or Yarkand in the Uighur language — was the scene of violent clashes in July, shortly before the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
Police officers then killed dozens of attackers "who were attacking civilians and vehicles," according to state media.
The fresh unrest underscores the deterioration of the situation in Xinjiang, where Beijing has launched a severe crackdown in recent months with dozens of executions officially announced and hundreds of arrests, followed by speedy mass trials and the public exhibition of so-called "terrorists."
Friday's attack comes five days after students of the imprisoned Uighur intellectual Ilham Tohti were brought before a Chinese court in a secret trial, accused — like their professor — of "separatism."
A Chinese judge Friday rejected Tohti's appeal against the life sentence imposed in September.
