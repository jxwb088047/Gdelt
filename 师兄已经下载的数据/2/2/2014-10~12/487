A group of 11 "mobsters" are reportedly killed by police after targeting street food stalls with explosives.
An attack in China has left 15 people dead and several others injured, according to the state news agency Xinhua.
The attackers used vehicles, knives and explosives in the assault in the western Xinjiang region, in what officials have called a terrorist attack.
Eleven of those killed were described as mobsters, who drove into a street of food stalls, threw explosive devices and stabbed people.
The attack happened on Friday afternoon, with some reports claiming that local police were responsible for the deaths of the perpetrators.
Xinjiang is frequently hit by unrest triggered by tensions between China's ethnic Han majority and the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs. Authorities regularly blame Uighur militants for the violence.
Some Uighurs in the northwest Chinese region are hostile to Beijing's leadership.
They say they are victims of discrimination and left out of the benefits of development in Xinjiang, which has seen an influx of Han Chinese moving in from elsewhere in the country.
Beijing has launched a severe crackdown in recent months with dozens of executions and hundreds of arrests, followed by quick mass trials and the public exhibition of so-called terrorists.
