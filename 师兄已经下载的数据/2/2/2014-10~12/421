A Chinese court sentenced three people to death and one to life in prison on Friday for an attack at a train station in southwestern China that triggered a SWEEPINGcrackdown on what Beijing calls militant violence.

The government said knife-wielding militants from the unruly western region of Xinjiang launched a premeditated attack in March at the Kunming station in Yunnan province, in which 31 people were killed and 141 injured. Police shot dead four of the attackers.

China\'s leaders have vowed to strike hard at religious extremists and separatist groups, which they blame for a series of violent attacks in Xinjiang, the traditional home of the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority.

{{#invoke: Navbox | navbox }} The Xinjiang conflict[1] is an ongoing[2] separatist struggle in the northwestern part of today's China. The indigenous Uighur people claim that the region, which they view as their fatherland and refer to as East Turkestan, is not part of China, but was invaded by China in 1949 and is since under Chinese occupation. China claims that the region has been part of China since ancient times, and nowadays calls it Xinjiang ("New Territory" or, officially, "old territory returned to the motherland"{{#invoke:Namespace detect|main}}{{#invoke:Namespace detect|main}}[citation needed]) province. The separatism effort is led by ethnically Uighur Muslim underground organizations, most notably the East Turkestan independence movement, against the Chinese government.
The Xinjiang Wars were a series of armed conflicts which took place within Xinjiang in the Republic of China during the Warlord Era and Chinese Civil War (early and mid-20th century). The wars also played an important role in the East Turkestan independence movement.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch speculate that Uyghur resentment towards alleged repression of Uyghur culture may explain some of the ethnic riots that have occurred in Xinjiang during the People's Republic of China (PRC) period.
Conversely, Han Chinese residents of the region believe that they are treated as second-class citizens by PRC policies, in which many of the ethnic autonomy policies are discriminatory against them (see Autonomous entities of China), and that previous Chinese dynasties owned Xinjiang before the Uyghur Empire. Independence advocates view Chinese rule in Xinjiang, and policies like the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, as Chinese imperialism.
Some put the beginning of the modern phase of the conflict in Xinjiang in the 1950s.[2]
In the 1980s there was a scattering of student demonstrations and riots against police action that took on an ethnic aspect; and the Baren Township riot in April, 1990, an abortive uprising, resulted in more than 50 deaths.{{#invoke:Namespace detect|main}}{{#invoke:Namespace detect|main}}[citation needed]
A police round-up and execution of 30 suspected separatists[3] during Ramadan resulted in large demonstrations in February 1997 which were characterised as riots in the Chinese state media,[4] but which western observers have described as peaceful.[5] These demonstrations culminated in the Gulja Incident on the 5th of February, in which a People's Liberation Army (PLA) crackdown on the demonstrations led to at least nine deaths [6] and perhaps more than 100.[3] The Ürümqi bus bombings of February 25, 1997 killed nine and injured 68. The situation in Xinjiang was relatively quiet from the late nineties through mid-2006, though inter-ethnic tensions no doubt remained.[7]
There next occurred a 2007 Xinjiang raid,[8] a thwarted 2008 suicide bombing attempt on a China Southern Airlines flight,[9] and the 2008 Xinjiang attack which resulted in the deaths of sixteen police officers four days before the Beijing Olympics.[10][11]
Further incidents include the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, the September 2009 Xinjiang unrest, and the 2010 Aksu bombing that led to the trials of 376 people.[12] The 2011 Hotan attack in July led to the deaths of 18 civilians. Although all of the attackers were Uyghur,[13] both Han and Uyghur people were victims.[14] In 2011, six ethnic Uyghur men attempted to hijack an aircraft heading to Ürümqi, but failed after passengers and crew resisted and restrained the hijackers.
On 24 April 2013, clashes occurred between social workers and police near Kashgar. The violence left at least 21 people dead, including 15 police and officials.[15][16][17] A local government official said that the clashes broke out after three local officials had reported suspicious men armed with knives who were hiding at a house in Selibuya township, outside Kashgar.[18]
Two months later, on 26 June 2013, 27 people were killed in riots; 17 of them were killed by rioters, while the other ten people were alleged assailants who were shot dead by police in the township of Lukqun.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]
