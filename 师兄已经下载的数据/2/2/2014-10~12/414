Donald Trump on the Brussels terrorist attacks: 'I would close up our borders'
Over at The Diplomat, Zachary Keck points out that the inaugural issue of al Qaeda's magazine Resurgence contains quite a few references to China. The communist country has been waging a sometimes brutal crackdown against separatists in Xinjiang, a far western region home to the Muslim minority Uighurs — and al Qaeda is suddenly taking note.
In an article titled "10 Facts About East Turkistan," the terrorist group lists a series of grievances and calls for Xinjiang to be "recovered [into] the shade of the Islamic Caliphate," reports the South China Morning Post. Keck notes that while the article "stops [short] of calling for jihad against China, the point is more directly articulated elsewhere" in the issue. It even asks followers to "disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and Strait of Malacca" to damage China's economy.
So, what's with al Qaeda's sudden interest in China? There has been an uptick in violence in Xinjiang recently — separatists have been blamed for numerous terrorist attacks and the Chinese government has cracked down harshly — but Keck sees another spark: ISIS. The leader of the ascendant terrorist group mentioned China in a speech in July, and ISIS later included Xinjiang in a map of its imagined caliphate.
New attention on China could also foreshadow a broader "pivot to Asia" on al Qaeda's part. The terrorist group established a branch in India in September, which experts interpreted as al Qaeda trying to regain its influence after being eclipsed in the Middle East by ISIS. Does al Qaeda see Xinjiang as a similar opportunity for growth? Nico Lauricella
Chilling footage shows the scene inside Brussels airport seconds after Tuesday's terrorist attack
After two explosions rocked the departure area of Belgium's Zaventem airport in Brussels early Tuesday, first-person footage from a traveler inside captured the immediate aftermath. In the video, smoke, debris, and abandoned suitcases fill the area near the American Airlines and Brussels Airlines check-in desks. Screams erupt as people run for their lives and hide under desks:
The two explosions at the airport and a third at a metro station in central Brussels — reportedly the work of suicide bombers — left as many as 26 people dead Tuesday. Becca Stanek

31 reported dead as explosions rock Brussels airport, metro station
As many as 31 people are dead after three terrorist bombings rocked major transportation hubs in Belgium. The federal prosecutor confirmed that 11 were killed after two bombs targeted the departure area of Belgium's Zaventem airport in Brussels early Tuesday. One of the explosions at Zaventem is believed to have been the work of a suicide bomber.
The Brussels mayor reports that 20 were killed and 106 wounded — 17 severely — when, an hour later, an explosion hit a metro station near the EU buildings in central Brussels.

The explosions come days after Belgian police arrested Salah Abdeslam, the only known surviving suspected attacker from the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris.
In Brussels, following an explosion in a metro tunnel, Belgian authorities shut down train, bus, and tram service, and requested that everyone stay sheltered in place and avoid making phone calls. "Use texting or social media," CrisisCentre Belgium tweeted.

Paris terror suspect Salah Abdeslam was also reportedly planning attacks in Germany
Salah Abdeslam, the suspected terrorist arrested in Brussels Friday in connection with the Paris terrorist attacks, was also reportedly planning to carry out attacks in Germany, The Telegraph's Justin Huggler reports. A report by Germany's SWR radio says that Abdeslam visited three men posing as Syrian refugees at a shelter in the southern German city of Ulm last October. After the visit, the three men reportedly all disappeared.
Abdeslam was part of an ISIS network set up to "explicitly" carry out attacks on countries, comprised of 30 members divided up into three cells. Many of the first cell's members were killed in a U.S. airstrike on Raqqa, Syria. The second cell is believed to be responsible for the terrorist attacks in Paris last November.
The third cell remains at large. It is unclear whether this cell may be responsible for the three terrorist attacks at major transportation hubs in Belgium Tuesday that left at least 26 people dead. Becca Stanek

Belgian authorities struggle to get a handle on terror threat: 'It's literally an impossible situation'
Belgian authorities have faced ongoing criticism for their missteps in addressing the terrorist threat in the heart of their country — criticisms that will likely only be exacerbated following the March 22 attacks in Brussels that have left at least 26 dead.
"We just don't have the people to watch anything else and, frankly, we don't have the infrastructure to properly investigate or monitor hundreds of individuals suspected of terror links as well as pursue the hundreds of open files and investigations we have," a Belgian counter-terrorism official told BuzzFeed last week. "It's literally an impossible situation and, honestly, it's very grave."
One 42-year-old Belgian man told BuzzFeed that the government divisions between the French-speaking south and Dutch-speaking north make the government "fractured and ineffective."
"This is what happens when you don’t have a real government and a divided bureaucracy,” he said.
An American survivor of the attack in the Maelbeek situation also expressed distress over Brussels' seeming inability to get the situation under control. "There are so many competing language groups. The police don't cooperate well together," Brian Carroll, 31, told The New York Times. Jeva Lange

Harrison Ford won't tell Jimmy Kimmel if Han Solo is really dead
If you haven't see Star Wars: The Force Awakens — and this is Harrison Ford's second time on Jimmy Kimmel Live to promote the months-old blockbuster — there are spoilers in the clip below, and in this introduction to it. You've been warned.
"I argued for 30 years for this to happen," Ford said of Han Solo's demise in the film. "And finally, I wore 'em down." Jimmy Kimmel asked the obvious follow-up: "So you won't be in any of the other movies, or Han Solo won't be in any of the other movies?" But Ford quickly interjected: "Who said that?" then tried to shift the conversation, but Kimmel sensed he was on to something. "Do you know if the character Han Solo will continue, or do you not know?" he asked. Ford locked up his lips, threw away the key, and did some other weird hand signals, before talking about reverse mortgages. You can try to glean clues, or just watch Ford get freaked out at Kimmel's guest-entrance hatch, in the video below. Peter Weber

American describes Maelbeek station attack: 'I thought to myself, 'I've got to get out of here''
At least 15 people were killed and 55 injured following an explosion on Tuesday that targeted a metro station near the EU buildings in central Brussels. Brian Carroll, 31, of Washington, was visiting Belgium for a conference; his train was pulling into the Maelbeek station when the explosion hit. Carroll spoke with The New York Times about what he saw:
"As we were pulling into the station, there was suddenly a loud explosion. There was smoke everywhere. Everyone dropped to the ground. People were screaming and crying. I was on the ground."
"We realized immediately we were being attacked by terrorists," [Carroll] continued. "For all I knew, there was a gunman going from car to car and shooting people."
Mr. Carroll said he remained on the ground for a minute or two, then got up, pried the door open with his hands and fled the station.
"I thought to myself, 'I've got to get out of here,'" he said. "I headed toward an exit. There was smoke and soot everywhere. There was glass everywhere. It was like running through a cloud of dust. I saw the exit of the station was destroyed. I ran out of the station, I ran as far as I could." [The New York Times]
Carroll called the event the most frightening experience of his life. "I hope Belgium gets its act together. This has been going on for a while, and the whole world is looking at Belgium," he said.

Donald Trump on the Brussels terrorist attacks: 'I would close up our borders'
Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump wasted no time in reiterating one of his few clear policy positions in the wake of Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Brussels. "I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on," he told Fox News early Tuesday morning.
"We can't have these attacks anymore," he added. "We have to be very, very careful who comes into our country."
Donald Trump similarly called for banning all Muslims from entering the United States after the December terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California. Critics have blasted the idea as unfeasible, immoral, and a probable recruiting tool for terrorists. Nico Lauricella
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
