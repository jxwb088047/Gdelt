Xinjiang mulls ban on veil in public - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is considering banning the veil from public places.
A draft regulation was passed by the Urumqi legislature's standing committee Wednesday. It will become effective if endorsed by the regional legislature.
"Veils are used by Islamic extremists to assert their power and existence," Ma Pinyan, with the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said. "Many Muslims are punished by extremists for refusing to wear such clothing."
Wang Ping, professor with Xinjiang Normal University, said, "Islamic teachings never ask follower to wear veils, and it is not a tradition for any ethnic group in Xinjiang."
Turgunjan, also of Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, believes the ban will be a legal basis for Xinjiang's campaign against religious extremism and suggested that the regulation could be more specific on the definitions of "veil" and "public place."
Urumqi taxi driver Turgun said, "Belief is something inside your heart, and there is no need for people to show off their belief by wearing a certain kind of clothes."
Tugul, a Uygur female working in a publishing institution, said, "The Koran did not ask us to wear the veil. The ban will make no difference to my life, since I never dress that way."
