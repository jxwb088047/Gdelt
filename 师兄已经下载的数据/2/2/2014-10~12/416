Anti-China Pakistan-Based Uyghur Jihadi Group East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) Issues Numerous Videos Online, Increases Attacks in Xinjiang And Other Chinese Regions
This report examines the proliferation of Uyghur jihadi videos on the Internet and increasing jihadi attacks in Chinese towns. In recent years, Uyghur Islamic militants have carried out a series of suicide bombings, knife attacks, and bomb explosions in different towns of China, especially in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, officially described as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. As the attacks show no signs of ceasing, the Chinese authorities are growingly worried over jihadi activities, resorting to panic measures. On May 28, Chinese officials organized a mass public sentencing of Islamic extremists at a stadium in Ili prefecture of Xinjiang, attended by more than 7,000 people.[1] At the stadium, at least 55 individuals were sentenced for crimes ranging from murder to terrorism, with three given the death penalty; authorities have also announced the arrest of dozens more on similar charges.[2]
On June 5, 2014, local courts in six cities and prefectures of Xinjiang sentenced 81 defendants in 23 terrorism cases to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment. According to a Chinese state media report, nine people were given the death penalty while 68 people were convicted of "organizing, leading, or participating in terrorist organizations, intentional homicide, arson or illegal manufacture, [and] storage and transport of explosives," and another 13 people were sentenced for "making and spreading audio or video information on terrorism, inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination, or teaching criminal methods."[3]
