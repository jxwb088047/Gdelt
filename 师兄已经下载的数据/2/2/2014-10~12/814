Stephen Harper's third visit to China has been a success on many fronts, including the signing of commercial deals valued at up to $2.5 billion dollars, opening of four new trade offices, an increase in nuclear cooperation, expansion of a transit without visa program, and an agreement to open a Renminbi trading hub (Canada becoming the first in the Americas).
These announcements add to the list of items that Canada has been able to achieve with China since 2006, including:
• receiving Approved Destination Status in 2009; 
• arrival of pandas in 2013; 
• various agreements on agricultural research, transport, climate change, cultural cooperation; 
• an overall increase in merchandise trade to $73B, making China our second largest trading partner; and
• the recent ratification of the Canada-China Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement.
However, various media outlets and pundits have given the impression that Prime Minister Harper and the Canadian government have been recently more muted on the human rights situation in China. Media often refer to Mr. Harper's quote from 2006: 

"I think Canadians want us to promote our trade relations worldwide, and we do that, but I don't think Canadians want us to sell out important Canadian values... They don't want us to sell that out to the almighty dollar."
A coalition of NGOs even wrote an open letter this month asking Mr. Harper to raise human rights issues during bilateral meetings.
In fact, since 2009, rather than Canada being less vocal on issues of human rights, it has arguably been more robust when it comes to China. They may not have received much press coverage, but some items that likely raised eyebrows in Beijing are below:
• Lead by Minister Jason Kenney, Canada has been a leader when it comes to showing support for the Dalai Lama and his causes, including taking in refugees from Arunachal Pradesh and hosting the World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet. Prime Minister Harper met again with the Dalai Lama -- on Parliament Hill -- in 2012.
• Canada is one of the few countries to consistently raise the persecution of the Falun Gong, both at the United Nations and in other fora.
• On the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, foreign minister John Baird recently called for an open accounting for the people who were killed, detained, or missing.
• The Government of Canada gave its national human rights award in 2012 to Hong Kong's Cardinal Zen, a fierce critic of the Chinese communist party.
• For the first time, Canada publicly expressed concern about the sex ratio imbalance and called on China to amend its "One Child Policy" and ensure that "policies related to the family are based on consent".
• Ministers have met with Rebiya Kadeer and the government has expressed concern multiple times about the situation facing Uyghur Muslims in China.
• Each year, despite Canada's official "One China Policy", multiple federal government ministers attend and speak at Taiwan's "Double Ten Night" (Taiwan's national day celebrations) in Ottawa, including (but not limited to) ministers Jason Kenney, John Duncan, Tony Clement, Julian Fantino, Chris Alexander, Kerri-Lynne Findlay, Vic Toews, Peter Kent, Bal Gosal, and Dianne Finley. In fact, the number of ministers in attendance has grown in recent years.
• Earlier this year, immigration minister Chris Alexander attended the funeral for Shanghai's bishop, Joseph Fan Zhongliang, one of the leaders of the underground Catholic Church in China.
• Previously, Minister Baird addressed the plight of Christians in China in various speeches, including one before the UN General Assembly. In one address, Baird described the Chinese government's mistreatment of religious minorities as "abhorrent acts" that "fly in the face of our core principles, our core values."
• Just last year, in launching the Office of Religious Freedom, Prime Minister Harper referenced the "repression and intimidation" that takes place. During this visit, Harper raised religious freedom with Zhejiang's communist party secretary Xia Balong.
Despite the above, China continues to want to do more business with Canada. However, given that many Canadians have serious misgivings about China and the communist party, various media outlets have reported that despite Chinese offers to negotiate a free trade agreement, Canada has yet to agree to such measures.
Significant challenges remain. Countering Chinese espionage remains a serious concern. Clearly, we need to do more in getting better access for Canadian companies and bringing greater balance to the trade relationship (currently it heavily favors China). Equally worrisome is the lack of improvement in certain consular cases, including the cases of Heseyin Celil, and Kevin and Julia Garratt. These and other pressing issues remain in the bilateral relationship.
What the Canadian government has successfully managed to do (so far) is maintain a strong, principled voice when it comes to promoting our values (including religious freedom) and promoting our economic interests.
The Canada-China FIPA isn’t a complete trade deal. It’s more like one chapter of a trade deal -- the chapter that deals with protecting investors’ rights. Under these agreements, foreign companies gain the right to sue the host country in an international tribunal that doesn’t answer to national courts. Critics say this essentially gives foreign companies the ability to trump Canadian laws. True, but under the Canada-China FIPA, a Chinese investor or business will have to prove they were subjected to different rules than would apply to a local investor or business. That strongly limits the extent to which Canadian laws can be challenged at the tribunals, and Canada’s ability to pass environmental and other laws likely won’t be as constrained as critics say. Canada will still be able to reject major investments from Chinese companies.Supporters of the Canada-China FIPA say Canada needs a deal like this with China because we are running a $30-billion-a year trade deficit with the country. To get our money back, we need Chinese investment, and the FIPA gives investors the confidence they need to put their money here.
In the treaty, the government retained the right to hide documents filed in a lawsuit against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA. This is despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that these rulings can go against Canadian government policy.
This trade treaty, meant to last a generation, got an hour of debate in front of the House of Commons’ trade committee, and that’s it.
NAFTA can be terminated in six months, but the Canada-China FIPA runs a minimum of 15 years, has a one-year notice of termination period, and extends rights to Chinese companies already operating in Canada by 15 years after the deal is cancelled.Supporters of the deal say the at minimum 31-year timeline makes sense for protecting long-term investments and projects.
So far, FIPAs have been advantageous to Canadian business because they have largely protected Canadian investments in other countries. (“Canadian mining companies are using FIPAs with developing countries to claim damages from community opposition to unwanted mega-projects,” the Council of Canadians reports.)But with China, Canada is on the other side of that equation — it’s largely the destination country for investment. “Canada will be much more exposed to claims and corresponding constraints” than China under the deal, Osgoode law prof Gus Van Harten writes.Though the deal sets up the same protections for Canadians investing in China as for Chinese investors in Canada, it creates “de facto non-reciprocity,” Van Harten argues, because of the imbalance in the trade relationship.
Even if a Chinese citizen owns a small portion of a Canadian company, they will be able to use the tribunals set up under the FIPA, Van Harten says.
British Columbia’s Hupacasath First Nation launched a court challenge on the constitutionality of the deal in January, 2013, arguing the government had violated its responsibility to consult with first nations on constitutional and treaty issues. The B.C. Supreme Court rejected that argument in October, 2013, but the first nation is now appealing that ruling before the Federal Court of Appeal.
