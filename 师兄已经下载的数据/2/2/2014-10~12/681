China sentences 12 to die over Xinjiang violence in late July | GlobalPost
A Chinese court on Monday sentenced 12 to death for attacks in the country's far western region of Xinjiang in late July that left nearly 100 people dead.
The Intermediate People's Court of Kashgar in the region also gave suspended death sentences to 15 others, life imprisonment to nine and prison terms ranging from four to 20 years to 20, according to an announcement on the Xinjiang government's news website.
Chinese authorities have said 96 people were killed following what they called "premeditated terror attacks" on July 28 in the region, where ethnic tensions between the Uyghur and Han communities have been high.
The attacks took place about three weeks after the fifth anniversary of rioting in 2009 that left 197 people dead and about 1,700 injured, mostly Han Chinese.
Those sentenced Monday were apparently all Uyghurs, judging by their names.
In early August, China's official Xinhua News Agency said a gang armed with knives stormed a police station and government offices in Elixku and some of them moved on to the nearby Huangdi Township, assaulting civilians and smashing vehicles as they passed.
Of the 96 killed, the authorities have said 59 of the attackers were gunned down by local security forces.
While Chinese authorities routinely blame "separatists" and "terrorists" for the outbreak of violence in Xinjiang, critics say the underlying cause is the country's high-handed policy toward ethnic minorities.
Uyghurs have long complained that racial discrimination and restrictions on religion are fueling anger at the Han Chinese majority.
