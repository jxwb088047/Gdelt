Gov't urged not to deport 155 Uighurs to China | World News | Jamaica Gleaner
KUALA LUMPUR, (AP): Human-rights groups have urged Malaysia not to deport 155 ethnic Uighur migrants, including 76 children, back to China, fearing they could face persecution.

A senior Malaysian immigration official said yesterday that authorities found 90 members of the Muslim minority group hiding in a three-bedroom apartment and 65 other Uighurs in another unit in an October 1 raid on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur that followed a tip-off.
The group, comprising 42 men, 37 women, 43 boys and 33 girls, has been sent to a detention centre pending an investigation, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the case's sensitivity.
Ethnic tensions in the Xinjiang region in western China, home of the Turkish-speaking Uighurs, have fuelled rising violence, with more than 300 people killed in the past year and a half. China blames the violence on secession-seeking terrorists. Uighurs complain of restrictive and discriminatory policies and practices by the government and the Han Chinese, the country's ethnic majority.
Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty said more information was needed to determine why the 155 Uighurs fled China.
"In order to assess whether the Uighurs are refugees fleeing persecution, our immigration authorities must grant them immediate access to UNHCR so that they may seek asylum and have refugee status determined," it said in a statement yesterday, referring to the United Nations' refugee agency.
