China’s detained ‘religious extremists’ mostly women, kids
(Radio Free Asia) Nearly all the members of a group of people detained by authorities in southwestern China near the border with Vietnam over the weekend are ethnic Uyghur women and children from China’s restive Xinjiang region, a source said Thursday.

According to state media, police in China’s Guangxi province on Sunday shot dead one person and detained 21 other “religious extremists” seeking to cross into neighboring Vietnam.

The report, carried by the official Xinhua news agency, did not identify the members of the group or say where they were from, but authorities in China frequently blame religious extremism for violence involving Uyghur Muslims from Xinjiang in the country’s northwest.
