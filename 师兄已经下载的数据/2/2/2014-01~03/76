Western Values Expelled from Chinese Universities - Billionaires Newswire
According to the state media, Yuan Guiren said that textbooks that promote Western values and criticise the nation's leaders or political system should be shunned from the classroom. Speaking at an education forum, he added that this was an important step for China to maintain its political integrity.
"Never let textbooks promoting western values appear in our classes." He also stated: “Remarks that slander the leadership of the Communist Party of China” and “smear socialism” must never appear in college classrooms.
It is the latest in a line of education reform under president Xi Jinping that suggest the government is tightening its grip on higher education in China.
For example, Xia Yeliang, an economics professor at the prestigious Peking University, was fired from his post in 2013 after calls for political change in China. Another prominent academic, Ilham Tohti, who had urged better dialogue between Beijing and the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, was jailed for life for separatism last year, while several of his students were also jailed.
It has also been touted that CCTV cameras are going to be added to some university classrooms so that state officials can monitor what is being taught at certain educational institutions.
