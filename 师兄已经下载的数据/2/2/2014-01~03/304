China Embraces World's Highest High-speed Railway Tunnel
Photo taken on March 11, 2014 shows the snow-topped entrance to the world's highest high-speed railway tunnel in northwest China's Qinghai Province. Located in the desolate Qilian Mountains at an average altitude of 3,600 to 4,300 meters above sea level, the world's highest high-speed railway tunnel is expected to be completed by April this year. Constructing the tunnel is considered one of most difficult parts of the process of developing the line linking Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu Province, with Urumqi, the capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The 1,776-kilometer Lanxin railway line runs across the Gansu and Qinghai provinces to Xinjiang, traversing the wind-ravaged Gobi Desert. [Photo: chinanews.com]
