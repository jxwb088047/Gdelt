Triple Explosions in China’s Xinjiang Kill Three
Triple explosions in China's Xinjiang have killed three people and wounded two others, authorities said Friday, in what appears to be the latest incident of unrest in the region.
One person was killed after two blasts in a hairdressing salon and market, while two others died inside a car which "self exploded" when surrounded by police, said the Tianshan web portal, a local government-run mouthpiece.
The explosions happened at about 6:40 pm (1040 GMT) in Xinhe in the Aksu prefecture, the report said, an area located at China's extreme west on its border with Kyrgyzstan.
In the worst outbreak of sectarian violence in recent years in China, around 200 people died and more than 1,600 were injured while hundreds were arrested in riots in the Xinjiang regional capital Urumqi in July 2009.
