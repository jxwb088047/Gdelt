China condemns US for sending Uighur inmates to Slovakia | Asia-Pacific | Worldbulletin News
China's Foreign Ministry criticised the United States on Thursday for sending the last three Uighur inmates at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre to Slovakia.
Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik, and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper are the last of 22 Muslim minority Chinese nationals to be moved from the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba, according to the Pentagon.
Slovakia's Interior Ministry confirmed that it would take in the three. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim people from China's far western region of East Turkistan (Xinjiang).
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the three were members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which Beijing labels a "terror group."
"They are genuine terrorists. They not only threaten China's security, they will threaten the security of the country that receives them," he told a daily news briefing.
"China hopes that the relevant country ... does not give asylum to terrorists, and sends them back toChina as soon as possible."
"These remarks neglect the facts and are feeble," he said. "We urge the United States to abandon their double standards when it comes to terrorism, and immediately stop saying one thing and doing another, to avoid sending the wrong message to violent terrorist forces."
The United States said it was grateful to Slovakia for its "humanitarian gesture."
Most of the Uighurs at Guantanamo were captured near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and were believed to have trained with the Taliban.Â 
In 2008, a U.S. court ordered that they be released. They have been resettled in El Salvador, Switzerland, Bermuda, Albania, and the Pacific island nation of Palau.
The U.S. government has said it will not return the Uighurs to China because they would face persecution there.
Many Uighurs chafe at restrictions on their culture, language and religion, though the government insists it grants them broad freedoms.
