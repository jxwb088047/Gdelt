Chinese authorities shot dead "several terrorists" during an "attack" in Xinjiang on Friday, state media said, the latest violent incident in the restive far-west region home to mostly Muslim ethnic minority Uighurs.
"Several terrorists were shot dead by police during a terrorist attack Friday afternoon," the Xinhua news agency said, without immediately providing any further details.
Xinjiang police and information officers reached by phone declined to comment to AFP.
The vast region has for years been hit by occasional unrest carried out by Uighurs, which rights groups say is driven by cultural oppression, intrusive security measures and immigration by Han Chinese.
Authorities routinely attribute such incidents to "terrorists", and argue that China faces a violent separatist movement in the area motivated by religious extremism and linked to foreign terrorist groups.
Experts question the strength of such a network, however, and information in the area is hard to independently verify.
Triple explosions hit the region in late January, killing at least three people, according to a Xinjiang government website. Police shot dead six people soon afterward.
