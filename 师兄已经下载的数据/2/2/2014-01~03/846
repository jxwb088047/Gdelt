33 dead after knife-men 'stabbed people madly' in China - ITV News
Knife-wielding "terrorists" have killed at least 33 and wounded over 100 people at a railway station in Kunming, China. The government has blamed separatists from Xinjiang for the deadly attack.
A total of 33 people have been killed following a mass knife attack at a Chinese train station.
Militants have been blamed for the attack in the western region of Xinjiang in which witnesses described knife-wielding men "stabbing people madly".
A parking attendant, who was standing nearby, said he could not believe what was happening when he saw the attackers.
"I walked out and I saw a person with a knife this big," he said, spreading his arms wide.
"Then I saw five or six of them. They all had knives and they were stabbing people madly over by the first and second ticket offices," he said.

 A suicide bomber blew themselves up at Brussels airport, killing a number of people, before a further blast at a metro station in the city.


 Charles Michel called the attacks a "dark day for Belgium", saying that military reinforcements have been deployed.
