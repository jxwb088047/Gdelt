DERA ISMAIL KHAN / ISLAMABAD: Entrenched in secret mountain bases on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan, Uighur fighters are gearing up for retribution against China to avenge the deaths of comrades in Beijing’s crackdown on a separatist movement, their leader told Reuters.
In a rare interview, Abdullah Mansour, leader of the rebel Turkestan Islamic Party, said it was his holy duty to fight the Chinese. “The fight against China is our Islamic responsibility and we have to fulfil it,” he said from an undisclosed location.
“China is not only our enemy, but it is the enemy of all Muslims … We have plans for many attacks in China,” he said. “We have a message to China that East Turkestan people and other Muslims have woken up. They cannot suppress us and Islam any more. Muslims will take revenge.”
Mansour gave Reuters no chance to ask about the attack in Kunming two weeks ago.
At least 29 people were killed in a mass stabbing at a Kunming train station, putting new spotlight on the largely Muslim Uighur ethnic minority from Xinjiang.
China faces violent separatist movement in area motivated by religious extremism.
29 people were stabbed to death yesterday while more than 130 others were injured in a mass stabbing.
Police shot dead 4 of 10 attackers who officials said were part of the attack orchestrated by Xinjiang separatists.
