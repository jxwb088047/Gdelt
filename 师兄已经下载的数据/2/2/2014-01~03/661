Kobe University Professor Missing After Trip Home To China - The Japan Daily Press
A Chinese-born professor from the University of Kobe has gone missing after he went back home for a quick visit. 57-year old Wang Ke, a professor of modern Chinese philosophical history, is also known for his prize-winning research on ethnic Xinjiang Uighurs in China.
Officials from the university said Wang left for China on March 1 and said he would return to Japan by March 10. But he later called his family in Japan to inform them that his return would be pushed back, as he needed to tend after his mother in Xian who is not feeling well. They have not heard from him since his last phone call. When his family in Japan phoned his mother in Xian, they discovered that his mother is not ill and that he has not visited her as he said in the phone call. As Wang is scheduled to attend a symposium in Singapore on March 21, university officials contacted the organizers there and found out that Wang informed them of his inability to attend the scheduled conference.
Born in Henan, China, Wang finished his doctoral program at the University of Tokyoâ€™s Graduate School of Arts in Sciences in 1994 and has been with the faculty of Kobe University since 2001. He won the prestigious Suntory Prize for Social Science and Humanities for his book on the Uighur independence movement in the 1930s and 40s. Wang is not the first Japan-based Chinese researcher who went missing since returning to China for a visit. In July 2013, Zhu Jianrong, professor of international relations and Chinese history at Tokyo Gakuen University, was held in Beijing and only released and allowed to return to Japan in January 2014. Known Uighur economist Ilham Tohti is still detained in China since January.
