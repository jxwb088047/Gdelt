A Uyghur policeman was killed by an attacker in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, on Monday, according to an announcement by the Urumqi Municipal Public Security Bureau.
The suspect, who was later identified as Uyghur named Ilyar Rehmutulla from Xinjiang's Aksu prefecture, attacked the 29-year-old policeman with bush-knife and axe at a local community in Saybagh District.
The suspect then went to the nearby Yashan Police Substation, where he was shot dead by police on the spot.
