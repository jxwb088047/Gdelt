Missing MH370: 'Stop victimising the Uyghur people', AsiaOne Asia News
A Malaysia Civil Defence Department employee is seen wearing a shirt that says "Pray 4 MH370" at a hotel, where the relatives of the passengers onboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are staying, in Putrajaya March 10, 2014.
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Do not use the Uyghur people as a scapegoat for the missing MH370 incident, said an Uyghur human rights activist on Wednesday.





 

Uyghur Human Rights Project director Alim Seytoff called for an end to rumours and instead asked for people to let the Malaysian government carry out its investigations unhindered.
"At a time of such great tragedy, it is important to let the Malaysian government to do its investigation and fully disclose what has happened to the Malaysian plane to the public," he told The Star in an email.
Alim, who is also president of the American Uyghur Association, said that it was "equally important" to stop victimising the Uyghur people without proof.
"Stop scapegoating the Uyghur people with rumours and conspiracy theories that are based on nothing but speculation at the moment," he said.
Speculation that the Uyghur ethnic minority in China is linked to the incident has been rife.
A group known as the Chinese Martyrs Brigade allegedly sent letters claiming responsibility to Chinese journalists earlier this week.
The letters claimed that the MH370 had been targeted as retaliation against the Government for "cruel persecution", a possible reference to Malaysia's deportation of six Uyghur asylum seekers back to China a year ago.
