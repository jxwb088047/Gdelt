11 ‘terrorists’ killed in attack in Xinjiang | The Indian Express
Fifteen people, including 11 alleged terrorists, were killed in a suicide attack Friday by Islamic militants in China’s volatile Xinjiang province that coincided with a visit here by US Secretary of State John Kerry.
The alleged terrorists, on motorbikes and in cars carrying gas cylinders, attacked a police team near the gate of a park around 4 pm (local time) in Wushi County in the Aksu Prefecture of the province.
Eight men were killed by police and three others died in suicide blasts during the attack Friday afternoon in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
The Tianshan web portal, run by the Xinjiang government, said besides the 11 attackers, two policemen and two passersby were killed while one assailant was detained. Photos posted on the site showed a charred police van and jeep.
Police said the “terrorists” had an unknown number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) cylinders in their car which they had attempted to use as bombs.
The attack coincided with Kerry’s visit to Beijing to hold talks with top Chinese leaders on a range of issues including human rights.
The province bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan has witnessed increasing confrontation between police and activists of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a Qaeda-backed group fighting for the separation of Xinjiang from China.
Six alleged terrorists were shot dead by police during an attack on a police station on January 24 in the county seat of Xinhe in the Aksu Prefecture. Last year, Beijing too for the first time witnessed a “suicide attack” at the Forbidden City here.
