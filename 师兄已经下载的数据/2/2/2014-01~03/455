A police officer was fatally stabbed in China’s western region of Xinjiang by an attacker who was later shot dead, authorities have said.
The official China News Service said on Wednesday that the suspect used unspecified weapons to injure a police officer in the city of Urumqi on Monday night. Officers who arrived at the site shot the attacker dead. The injured officer later died. He was 29.
The report did not identify the ethnicity of the assailant but it was the latest in a series of attacks pointing to growing unrest in the region.
Xinjiang is home to a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule among parts of the native Turkic Uighur population.
