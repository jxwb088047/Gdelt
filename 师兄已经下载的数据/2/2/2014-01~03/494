China seeks international support to curb Terrorism
Chinese authorities have appealed to the international community for 'more understanding and support' in their fight against the ongoing violence and terrorism.
Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the National People's Congress made remarks days after masked attackers armed with knives killed nearly 30 people and injured 130 more at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming.
'Terrorism does not have national boundaries. We wish and expect that our efforts to crack down on terrorism will gain international understanding and support in the future,' media outlets quoted Fu as saying on Tuesday.
In the wake of the brutal Kunming attack, Chinese authorities have vowed to take firm action to root out terrorist organizations in order to 'safeguard national stability.'
The remarks come after US and some of its western allies failed to acknowledge the attack as an act of terrorism. Chinese media outlets have strongly criticized Washington for its double standard on war against terrorism.
There was no claim of responsibility for the latest brutal attack, but Chinese media said separatists from China's northwest region of Xinjiang were behind the incident.
The Turkic-speaking Xinjiang is home to a large population of Uighur, who complain of marginalization.
The autonomous region has been the scene of numerous violent incidents in recent years. Ethnic clashes between Uighur and Han Chinese communities in 2009 in Urumqi left nearly 200 people dead.
This is while Chinese officials in Beijing are holding emergency meetings to boost safety and security in the capital and other major cities. Senior officials in Beijing have also called for strengthening security on public transportation such as buses and the city's massive and sprawling subway system.
