Philanthropist Alimjan Halik, a lamb kebab seller by trade from northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has been raising funds to help the victims of the Kunming terrorist attack.
Halik has raised 45,000 yuan (7,377 USD)Â from fellow entrepreneurs as of Tuesday afternoon. He is looking for victims to donate the money to with the help of Yunnan Information, a newspaper in southwest China.
Halik says he wants to give the money to those in need, stating, "I saw on TV that people are condemning the attack. Actions speak louder than words; that's why we have to do something to help the victims with their difficulties."
Halik is calling for more help and says the Xinjiang separatists don't speak for all Uygur people.
Many Uygur people have taken to China's social media to show their kindness after the attack, saying they feel just as angry and sad for what happened as the rest of the population. The topic thread "I'm a Xinjiang native" is trending on Weibo, providing people with a forum to share their views and condolences.
Wan Jinguang, who donated 20,000 yuan (3,279 USD) as a result of Halik's appeal, says the Uygurs are a kind-hearted people. "I have many Uygur friends. They are very nice and nothing like the terrorists. Please don't misunderstand them," Wan says.
Halik and his friends say they hope more people will extend a helping hand in an effort to eliminate misunderstandings and maintain ethnic unity.
Alimjan Halik is known for his decade-long efforts to help fund the education of poor students in southwest China's Guizhou province. He has donated more than 100,000 yuan (16,393 USD) through selling lamb kebabs and was honored with the title "2011 Personality Who Moved the Hearts of Chinese People".
