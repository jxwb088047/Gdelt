China’s Foreign Ministry has criticized the United States for sending three Uyghur Chinese inmates previously held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center to Slovakia, instead of back to China.
The ministry said the three men were terrorist threats, and urged countries not to provide them with asylum."They are members of the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which has been labelled by the UN as a terrorist group. They are genuine terrorists. They not only threaten China’s security, they will also threaten the security of the country that receives them." Qin Gang, Spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
Meanwhile, Qin urged the US to abandon double standards and avoid sending the wrong signal to violent terrorist forces.
The US Defense and State Department said in a joint statement that the US transferred the last three Chinese East Turkestan Islamic Movement prisoners detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention center to Slovakia.
Media reports said even though they were deemed to have no relation with Al-Qaeda and Taliban group, they had been detained in prison for three years. They also said it was a milestone event for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay. China has requested the US to send the three back to China but was rejected by the US.
Meanwhile, Slovakia Interior Ministry has confirmed the information and said the three are at a immigration center. It also said its government will help them seek jobs after they learnt the Slovakia language. But it stressed one of the three is a terrorist suspect.
