Uighur separatists blamed for mass stabbing at a train station - Updated News
An attack by knife-wielding men at a railway station in Kunming in south-west China has left 34 people dead and 130 others injured, state media said.
Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought the same media said.
A survivor named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the back and chest, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when attackers dressed in black rushed into the station. I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone, adding that people who were slower ended up severely injured. “They just fell on the ground,’’ Mr Yang said.
Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was “a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces”, the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities.
