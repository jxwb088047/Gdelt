Chinese police yesterday shot and killed eight people who attacked a convoy of patrol cars in the nation’s northwestern Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, a website run by the local government’s press office said.
Three additional suspects died after explosives they were carrying blew up during the attack in Wushi county in Aksu prefecture, according to the report on Tianshannet.com.cn. Two policemen and two civilians were injured and five patrol cars damaged, it said.
Tensions between Han Chinese, who comprise more than 90 percent of the national population, and the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang have led to an increase in violent clashes in the area, including an incident on Jan. 24 in which police shot and killed six rioters who were planting explosives.
On Dec. 30, police killed eight people who attacked their station in Shache county. Two weeks earlier, 14 rioters and two police officers were killed in a confrontation in Shufu county. In June, at least 35 people, including two policemen, died when rioters attacked police stations in Shanshan county. Eleven of those assailants were killed, police said.
The Communist Party’s Politburo on Jan. 24 named President Xi Jinping to head the newly elected national security committee, Xinhua News Agency said, as the government tries to quell rising public discontent.
