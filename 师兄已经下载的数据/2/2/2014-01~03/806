CHINA - The number of terrorist attacks in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has been kept to a minimum by the imposition of a range of counterterrorism measures, the region's Party chief said on Thursday.





 

"Terrorist attacks are not caused by the policy of striking hard, but result from the international environment and Xinjiang's special situation," said Zhang Chunxian, Party chief of Xinjiang, during a group discussion among the region's delegation at the 12th National People's Congress.
"It is an international political phenomenon. In a world in which religious extremism is starting to revive, such attacks are bound to happen," he said.
"We will show no mercy to terrorists, and the region will resolutely crack down on them — otherwise, they will become arrogant," Zhang said during the discussion, which was open to the media.
He added that as China's globalisation progresses, about 90 per cent of the terrorists who carried out recent attacks made use of information from online sources banned in China.
Although terrorist attacks have begun to occur in some unexpected areas, such attacks can still be prevented, Zhang added.
"They always attack and fail and then strike again, but they will be eliminated in the end," Nur Bekri, chairman of the region, said during the discussion.
Zhang said the crackdown policy only applies to terrorists and doesn't target the majority of the public or a certain group of people.
