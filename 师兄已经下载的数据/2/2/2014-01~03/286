Fear and anger as China reflects on terror , AsiaOne Asia News
KUNMING, China - Defiant residents of the Chinese city that saw a mass stabbing queued to give blood Monday, while others vented their anger at what authorities say was a terrorist attack staged by separatists from far-off Xinjiang.





 

One woman taxi driver told AFP she would not take passengers to Kunming railway station, the scene of the violent rampage which left 29 people dead, underscoring the tense sense of fear that has gripped the usually quiet city.
She then launched into a tirade against Uighurs, the mainly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang.
"I won't let them into my taxi. They are all drug addicts and everyone outside Xinjiang distrusts them," she said, refusing to give her name.
"Nobody will rent apartments to them. They are trouble. Most people thought like this before, so you can imagine what people think now," she added, hitting her steering wheel for emphasis.
Xinjiang is periodically hit by violent clashes between locals and security forces, but attacks targeting civilians are rarer.
Incidents are almost unheard of in Yunnan province, which is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) from Xinjiang and a popular tourist destination.
