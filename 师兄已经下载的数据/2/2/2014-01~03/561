UN Denounces Deadly Terrorist Attack On Chinese Railway Station
The United Nations Security Council has strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack on a railway station in China's south-western city of Kunming, and underlined the need to bring those responsible to justice.
In a statement late Sunday, the 15-member body extended its deepest sympathy and condolence to the victims and their families suffering as a result of this "most heinous" terrorist attack, as well as to the people and the Government of China.
"The members of the Security Council underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this terrorist attack to justice, and urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant governments in this regard," read the UNSC statement.
According to media reports, some 29 people were killed and at least 130 wounded after a group of attackers, dressed in black, burst into the train station in Kunming on on March 1 and began hacking people at random. China has since blamed the attack on Xinjiang separatist forces.
Soon after the incident took place on Saturday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had strongly condemned the attack and expressed hopes that those responsible would be brought to justice as soon as possible.
"The Secretary-General notes that there is no justification for the killing of innocent civilians and hopes that those responsible will be brought to justice," a statement issued by the UN chief's spokesman said on Saturday.
