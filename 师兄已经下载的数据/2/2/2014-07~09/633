Photo exhibition on Xinjiang opens in Bulgaria - People's Daily Online

 SOFIA, July 3 -- A photo exhibition "Yin and Yang in Xinjiang" dedicated to the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and China opened here on Thursday.

 The two-week event, jointly organized by the Institute for Culture and the Diplomatic Institute at Bulgaria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), shows 42 photos.

 They were taken by Rumyana Toneva, one of the leading Bulgarian photojournalists, during her journey in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region last August together with 13 photographers from different countries at the invitation of China Radio International.

 Angel Orbetsov, head of Asia, Australia and Oceania Directorate at MFA, said at the opening ceremony attended by Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Wei Jinghua that the author has reflected very well the whole diversity of this unique region in China, and this exhibition fits perfectly in the celebrations of the 65th anniversary of the bilateral relations.

 "I wanted to show my love to all the 47 ethnic groups that live in the wonderful Xinjiang, who have preserved their great culture and traditions; people who love their origin, love each other and live together, regardless of the differences," Toneva told Xinhua.

 "They are just one whole. That's why I called this exhibition Yin and Yang in Xinjiang," she said.
