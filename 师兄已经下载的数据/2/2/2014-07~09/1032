Plan to build border city in Xinjiang Ok'd - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
State Council has approved a plan to build a city on China-Kazakhstan border in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and work is already underway.
The city, which will be called Horgos, is positioned as an international trade and logistic hub, local official said on Friday.
It will cover an area of 1,970 square kilometers, including the existing 73 square kilometers of Horgos special economic zone, said Yang Jun, deputy director of the economic zone.
The State Council approved the plan based on Horgos special economic zone on June 29. Yang said the proposal was filed in 2010 and he believes the idea of building the Silk Road Economic Belt has fast-forwarded the process.
"Besides the special economic zone, two nearby townships will also be under the administration of the new city, which will be built in both Asian and European styles," Yang said.
"After Horgos becomes a city, it could be included in the overall planning of the central government and receive direct funding for infrastructure and improving people's livelihood."
