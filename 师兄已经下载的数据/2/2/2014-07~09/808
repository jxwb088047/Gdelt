"I earned 10,000 Yuan in two days. China-Eurasia Expo (CEE) lets more people know our carpets," Nazila Hamidi, a carpet maker from Iran, said on Wednesday.
Nazila Hamidi is selling his products at the fourth China-Eurasia Expo, opened on Monday in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
CEE has attracted roughly 25,000 businessmen from China and 60 foreign countries and international organizations.
According to Hamidi, it is his third time to participate in the CEE as his company employs about 20 workers and produces fine, wool carpets.
"All of our products are made by hand with high quality. One middle-sized carpet takes about two years to complete, so the prices are much higher than that of common products," Hamidi said.
"The CEE lets more people know us. We are confident about the development of Silk Road Economic Belt, hoping Iranian magic carpets would bloom along it," he added.
The Silk Road Economic Belt, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Central Asia in September 2013, involves over 40 Asian and European countries and regions with a combined population of 3 billion.
Hamidi and many other participants believe CEE will help their businesses and, in a due course, make its contribution to the economic and cultural revival of the ancient Silk Road.
