One fateful day, Deputy Matt Holman of the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office shined his spotlight on a homeless man walking down the road. The man was Robert Morris, and Officer Holman soon learned he’d been dealt a rough hand. Together, the two walked to the nearby church and struck up a conversation. Robert said his tent in the woods washed away in the flood. He lost his family and got addicted to drugs and alcohol, which ruined his relationships with his existing brother and sister.

Inspired by this man’s story, the officer began rummaging through his trunk to find the extra Bible he kept in his car. He couldn’t find it, so instead he did something incredible. Officer Holman gave Robert his very own personal Bible which contained his scribbled notes and highlighted scriptures from over the years. As attached to this Bible as he was, Officer Holman knew that giving it to Robert was the right thing to do. Officer Holman then realized that Robert was hungry. He offered to get Robert some food, then refused to accept the few crumpled up dollars that Robert offered him. “Go sit on the steps and I’ll be right back,” the officer said. He returned with a plate of hot food, which Robert gladly accepted.

Six months later, Officer Holman received a voicemail. It was from Robert, and what he said left him speechless. In the video below, you’ll hear Robert’s actual 911 recording, in which he details the heartwarming story. On March 18, 2015, Robert passed away unexpectedly — but because of one kindhearted officer, he had become a changed man....

A police officer without training is an accident waiting to happen! Here is an excellent example of how proper ground control defensive tactics training gives an officer the ability to control the suspect without having to resort to deadly force. Plus, Ryron and Rener teach a critical transition from armbar to handcuffs that every jiu-jitsu trained police officer must know!

A Battle Creek man has officially been charged after firing shots at police and holding them at bay over the weekend. Dariyone Zamone Clark-Brown, 21, has been charged with seven counts, including Assault with Intent to Murder, Fleeing and Eluding Police, Carrying a Concealed Weapon and Driving without a Valid License after the incident Saturday afternoon.

Police say that they stopped a vehicle driven by Clark-Brown at about 3:15pm Saturday near Hubband and Goodale Streets in Battle Creek. During the stop, they say Clark-Brown fired at police and then fled. The chase ended at a home on W. Coolidge when Clark-Brown ran from the vehicle and barricaded himself inside. He was later arrested without incident.

Dashcam video shows how Clark-Brown fired at the officer from almost point blank range. The officer turned his body just enough to miss being hit.

2/6/2016 – OKC, OK (By Brian Bates) — On Jun. 18, 2014 Oklahoma City patrol officer Daniel Holtzclaw was brought to an interrogation room within minutes of showing up to work. He was then questioned for over two hours by sex crimes detectives Kim Davis and Rocky Gregory.

The detectives were investigating a complaint by an Oklahoma City woman named Jannie Ligons – who claimed Holtzclaw stopped her in the early morning hours and sexually assaulted her.

Unlike the video posted by news outlets, this is the only unredacted copy online.

Watch and ask yourself if you’re watching the life of an innocent man ruined or the denials of a serial rapist with a badge.

This documentary of a Roseville Police Officer was created as a school video project for my News & Broadcasting class at Roseville High School. I went on a quick ride along with a Police Officer from the Roseville Police Department, who is also the Liaison Officer of my high school.

A police officer (also known as a policeman or policewoman, and constable in some forces, particularly in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations) is a warranted employee of a police force. In the United States, "officer" is the formal name of the lowest police rank; in many other countries "officer" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often "constable". Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers.
Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, and investigation techniques into major crime, including fraud, rape, murder and drug trafficking.
Responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property, and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, rules and procedures dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers, while off duty.
