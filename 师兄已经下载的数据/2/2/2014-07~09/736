Muslims across China are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, also called the Feast of Breaking the Fast, a three-day holiday at the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.Eid is a time to celebrate, relax, bond with families, shop and eat. Muslims from ten ethnic groups across China, including the Hui and Uygur, gather in mosques to pray to Allah. New clothes are given as gifts to children and adults; more importantly, to the poor and needy. Family members get together to eat traditional foods and visit relatives and friends.
