The Peninsula Qatar - 9 terror suspects killed in Xinjiang

BEIJING: Nine “terror suspects” were killed and one was captured in Hotan Prefecture of China’s western region of Xinjiang, Xinhua said yesterday, citing police. It gave no details. China usually uses the term “terror suspects” to describe Islamist militants or separatists.
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka extended an “unqualified apology” to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday over an article and uncomplimentary illustration of him and the Chief Minister of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa Jayaram, published on a government website. The defence ministry said it had taken down the caricature following complaints.
TOKYO: Japan yesterday named about 160 uninhabited islets at the edge of its territorial waters, including a group that is part of an archipelago also claimed by China. The apparent bid to stake Tokyo’s claim to the tiny territory may inflame tensions with Beijing which has been at loggerheads with Japan over the chain of islands in the East China Sea.  The group, believed to harbour vast natural resources below its seabed, is called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
YANGON: Myanmar’s army has freed 91 children and young people from its armed forces, the UN said yesterday, in the country’s latest move towards ending the use of child soldiers. The reformist government of the formerly junta-run nation committed to ending the recruitment and use of children in its “tatmadaw” army in a June 2012 pact with the UN.
