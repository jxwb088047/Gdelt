BEIJING:Â  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is quoted on the record as saying that he feels "deeply disturbed" that China is arresting Uighur terrorists.
According to the BBC News, "The United States has expressed strong concern after China jailed Uighur academic Ilham Tohti for life. Secretary of State John Kerry said he was "deeply disturbed" at the move. He and the White House both called for Tohti's immediate release."
Kerry claims that Uighur separatist instigators play a "vital role to reduce tensions" in China.
As reported by the BBC, "China's foreign ministry said it was opposed to foreign interference in China's judicial sovereignty. Tohti was jailed on Tuesday after Chinese authorities accused him of promoting separatism."
