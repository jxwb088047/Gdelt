China says ‘rescues’ more children from Xinjiang religious schools - Asia Bulletin
A sweep on illegal religious activity in the capital of China’s unruly far western region of Xinjiang has resulted in 190 children being ';rescued';, along with the detention of dozens of people, a state newspaper said on Monday. Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people who speak a Turkic language, has been beset for years by violence that the Chinese government blames on Islamist militants and separatists. Hundreds have died in violence in Xinjiang in the past 18 months, prompting a sweeping crackdown by the government, including on religious activities. Last month the governmen...
In the previousfive to tenyears the number of science parks in Russia hasgrownrapidly. Officially, there are nowmore than 300.
Experts, however, saya large number exist on paper only. For example, they might justbe office buildings, and notcenters of technologicalinnovation and development that the country needs in these difficult times.
According to the Russian Association of Clusters and Science Parks, there are only about70 genuinefull-fledged science parks in Russia. Theseare places where tech entrepreneurs can receive the full spectrumof necessary support.
"A genuinescience park consists of laboratories, and organizeseducational andaccelerationevents, as well as providesupport for startups that want to reachinternational markets; but the majority of science parks in Russia are either industrial areasor just office buildings," Renat Batyrov, general directorof the Skolkovo Science Park, told RBTH. He points to the IT-park in Kazan,and the Novosibirsk Science Park as examples of trulysuccessful projects.
In thesetimes of economic crisis and shortage of financing Russian science parks can onlycount onstate support. Private domesticinvestors are tightening budgets, andforeign investors are blocked by sanctions.
"If the government decides to invest in science parks, it would be one of the most effective anti-crisis measures," saidthe RussianAssociation of Clusters and Science Parks in a statement. "This would help create new high-tech companies and new jobs. Scienceparkscreate favorable conditions for the development of new businesses."
According to the Russian Communications Ministry, most science parks specialize in the IT field. Other fields include medicine, biotech, nanotechnology, and the development of new materials. One more important sector for Russia is the oil and gas industry.
Russia's massive size has an impact on science parks' specializations and geographic orientation. Parks in the Far East and Siberiaare oriented moretowards collaboration with China, Japan and South Korea.
"Due to our proximity, wecan serve asa window to Asia for Russian tech companies," Anatoly Semenov, directorof the Yakutia Science Park inSiberia, told RBTH. Thispark alreadyhas joint projects with a South Korean bio-tech companyinChuncheon Province.
Science parks in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad feel a stronger tieto Europe.
"We are oriented moretowards Finland, the Czech Republic and those countries closest to St. Petersburg," said Alexander Koloustov, director of the science park at the St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics.
The type of businessoften influences cooperation with other countries. For example, French companies are interested in Russia's south with its proximity to the markets of Eastern Europe and its agro-industrial potential.
"Due to the presence of Renault in our city, we are actively developing automobile technologies; and many French citizenscurrently live in Togliatti," noted Alexei Kokotkin, deputy general director of the Zhigulevskaya Dolina Science Park, whichalso collaborates with France in the field of space technologies.
As far as the futureMr. Batyrov believes that thepseudo science parks operatinginoffice buildingswill eventually vanish. Geographical specialization will be preserved and will possibly become even more defined.
"Considering Russia's technological needs there should bea science parkin every city witha population over 500,000 people,'' saidBatyrov. "It'snecessary to coordinatethe best parks, andcreate information systems that will help residents find partners in other science parks at homeand abroad.''
