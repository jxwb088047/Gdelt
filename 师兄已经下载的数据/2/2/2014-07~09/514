Israel and America: Time for a Trial Separation | Jewish & Israel News Algemeiner.com
From the Oval Office, U.S. President Barack Obama speaks on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sept. 27, 2013.
The Obama Administration has halted a shipment of Hellfire aerial anti-armor missiles to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing government sources.
Not since the early 1980s, when the Reagan Administration withheld delivery of promised F-16 fighter planes as a response to Israel’s bombing of Iraq’s nuclear plant in Osirak, has the U.S. acted in such a brazen, reckless manner.
Coincidentally, Washington recently signed a $4 billion arms deal with Turkey. This agreement comes on the heels of the $11 billion deal that was finalized a few weeks ago between the U.S. and Qatar, a country described by former Israeli President Shimon Peres as “the world’s largest funder of terror.”
With Barack Obama outsourcing Washington’s Middle East policy to two of Hamas’s primary benefactors, Israel may want to consider a trial separation from its ‘special relationship’ with the United States.
After all, being America’s faithful and acquiescent life partner has left Israel divided internally and isolated internationally.
What is a country to do when it is feeling neglected, trapped, unappreciated, or generally underwhelmed with its current relationship?
While the sun may not be setting on the greatest free empire the world has ever known, the Israeli government should consider developing mutually beneficial relationships with countries that are united by common concerns.
For in reality Barack Obama’s intended policy of benign neglect vis-Ã -vis the Middle East has actually proven to be one of malignant neglect, weakening traditional allies while emboldening foes.
Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the spillover effect in Syria on the rest of the region are three problems that Israel shares with Saudi Arabia and the moderate states in the Persian Gulf.
Regarding the Gaza War, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, along with Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, would like to see an end to Hamas’ rule over the Gaza Strip. Moreover, they seem to support the idea of disarming Hamas as part of any agreement to end the current crisis.
In contrast, the Obama Administration is working to prevent the collapse of Hamas.
By siding with Qatar and Turkey, the Obama Administration is effectively expressing its opposition to the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip.
Moreover, the Obama Administration now finds itself on the same side with Iran, which is also vehemently opposed to disarming Hamas.
Further east, another potential suitor for Israel is China. Faced with its worst terror attacks in decades in Xinjiang and elsewhere, China is seeking Israeli help in counter-terrorism. Beijing increasingly valuesIsrael as a rock of stability in a sea of Islamic upheaval in the Middle East.
Untethered by lingering feelings of guilt, misplaced fidelity or fear, Israel should consider not one, insufferable, domineering sugar daddy, but several potentially promising prospects.
Perhaps Israel’s move towards independence will actually strengthen the currently frayed bonds with Washington. There are numerous benefits of this bilateral relationship. Israel is an important partner in dealing with evolving terrorist and military threats as well as preserving the competitiveness of the U.S. defense-industrial base through joint development efforts and cutting-edge technology.
Furthermore, Israel has facilitated U.S. efforts to deal with emerging soft security challenges related to economic competitiveness, the information technology revolution, resource sustainability, and public health.
Since this would be a trial separation, not a divorce, Doomsday prognosticators who cannot imagine Israel remaining viable without its annual $3 billion infusion can exhale.
To paraphrase the acclaimed self-help guru Stuart Smalley with regards to Israel: ‘you’re good, you’re smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.’
. Where is our President Obama as our foreign policy has turned into a complete disaster.
Video of Rabbi Dr. Bernhard Rosenberg SAYS: President Obama, You Have Some Nerve:.
Another holocaust is possible. If it happened once it can happen again. Thank G-d we have Israel. We need to do everything possible to keep Israel militarily strong. Jews get out of Europe. There can be no compromise regarding Israel nor can we depend on the good will of others. This unfortunately is a lesson that many Jews have never learned. Never forget, never forgive never again. Rabbi Dr. Bernhard Rosenberg
Will Israel also turn down American foreign aid which is used to buy the weapons? Bon Chance.
American “foreign aid” is not a gift. Israel earned that when they made peace with Egypt. Obama may not appreciate a peaceful Egypt,(or Jordan) but most Presidents do.
Obama loves Iran. He spent 7 impressionable childhood years in Indonesia, a Muslim country, learning Islam in the idealized form that all people use in teaching their children about religion. And he learned about the powerful nation of Persia (Iran) important to Islamic history. He doesn’t see America as a power, he sees us as imperialists. It’s Persia that holds the power and the glory. If Iran has the bomb and once again rules the world, we’ll all be okay as he was taught in a childhood awed by Persia’s glorious power amid golden minarets and jeweled sunsets.
First where the heck are the Jewish Community leaders?? Second where are the Jewish congresspeople?? Are they so intimidated by Obama? Do they fear being labeled racist? The Democrats tremble before Obama. One can no longer deny that Obama is HOSTILE to Israel. Obama/Hillary/Kerry actually make Bush/Baker look good. Has the administration castgated hamas/pa/abbas/fatah since April? No indeed US aid has flowed unhindered to pa/hamas, to this day. If the US denounced, or even criticized pa/hamas told them specifically “No Moe Rockets” and agreed that they can NOT be trusted to have a seaport or airport peace would be closer. Hamas knows Obama/eu/un will always protect them and any concession to hamas/pa will only encourage the next round of WAR
The majority of Americans finally understand that Obama is not to be trusted. It is not just Israel he has turned his back on it is America. The majority that elected him, then re-elected him did so because of his race alone. He was a nobody until a very powerful few “placed him” in the position of being elected then saw to it he was. By all means distance yourselves from him as we have and by all means do what you have to do to continue defending yourselves from HAMAS. If the United States still exists in a couple of years perhaps our bridges can be once again mended.
When we ever learn, we can’t depend on others we must do it ourselves. Israel can and should start to produce and manufacture its own weaponry, it would only help in the employment of many thousands of Israeli’s. Obama, is not nor has he ever been a true friend of Israel, he cuddles up to the terrorist (oh I’m sorry combatants), Hamas, now Turkey, Qatar, each and every country that has a majority of Muslims, is his favorite. Meanwhile the Jewish leadership in our country is swinging back to the 40’s, see no evil hear no evil and SPEAK NO EVIL. Silence reigns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please, if anyone can convince Israel to move away from Barry’s influence, please do so now.
Certainly in specifically targeted ways where the materiel can eventually be sourced in-house. But that’s fairly expensive to start up from scratch. On the other hand some things can’t be sourced in-house like warships, subs and fighter bomber aircraft. So those items have to come from elsewhere. And China, India and Russia just aren’t up to US, British, French or even Swedish standards. It will probably take a revolutionary leap in the technologies Israel already leads in – drones. And this will require a new combat and defense doctrine.
It will take time to ramp up, so it would be good to see Israel sign a few weaponry deals outside the US quickly. We need to become independent of a US President whose policies increasingly benefit Islamists.
JNS.org – This Israeli success story is, in a way, made of plastic — but it’s also real. With its products now sold in more than 90 countries, Israel’s Keter is among the largest plastic companies in the world. On its website, Keter (which means “crown” in Hebrew) gushes with pride about its roots in the so-called “start-up nation.” “The ‘Made in Israel’ headquarters is now encouraging Israeli manufacturers to proudly display the Made in Israel label on their products, packaging, […]
JNS.org – When Asher Willner, a senior at Yeshiva University High School of Los Angeles (YULA), started a senior year engineering project in his father’s optical communications laboratory at the University of Southern California, he couldn’t envision where it would transmit him. But next week, beginning March 15, Asher will present his research at the Intel Science Talent Search competition as one of 40 finalists among 1,750 applicants. “When I submitted my application, it was just to see what would happen,” […]
JNS.org – Andreas Boldt can’t help but effuse praise and love for Israel with seemingly any chance he gets — with his kids, too. In some of his Facebook posts, the 37-year-old has his dirty blonde-haired children (ages 5-13) passionately singing “Adon Olam” and “Hatikvah.” Documenting a recent trip to Israel, he took particular pride in his meeting with IDF Maj. Gen. (ret.) Doron Almog, the first commando to land on the Entebbe runway for the famous hostage-rescue mission in 1976. With […]
Back in 1977, Mike Evans was the director of Bnei Yeshua, an openly messianic congregation he founded in Texas and moved to Stony Brook, NY. According to press reports, the group held Friday night services with a pulpit adorned with a star of David, holding prayers and singing songs in Hebrew, all dedicated to Jesus. When Bnei Yeshua started to proselytize on the streets and on nearby college campuses promoting Evan’s message that the goal was “to see every Jewish person […]
JNS.org – In 2003, Jeremy Lustman began working at the Washington, DC metro area’s DLA Piper law firm. Young and motivated, he could have never predicted the market crash that arrived in 2007. By 2009, Lustman had seen many of his colleagues laid off. While he was still gainfully employed, he too had a lot more time on his hands. Rather than sit around and wait for his name to come across the chopping block, Lustman decided to pitch his way […]
Nothing Abides: Perspectives on the Middle East and Islam, by Daniel Pipes. Transaction Publishers, 2015. More doggedly than any other expert on Middle East affairs Daniel Pipes has riveted his attention upon the threat that radical Islam poses to civilized life in nearly every corner of the globe. The Boston Globe was not indulging in hyperbole when it stated, “If Pipes’ admonitions had been heeded, there might never have been a 9/11.” He is the polar opposite to the willfully […]
JNS.org – Several Viennese Jews have made a lasting impact on the world. Sigmund Freud’s investigations changed the face of modern psychology. Composer Arnold Schoenberg’s innovations in atonal music changed the face of music. These days, even more Jews — in particular, Israeli Jews — are changing the face of Vienna’s culinary scene with innovations in…the art of the pita. Freudians may find a psychoanalytic motive for the local appeal of the Israeli eateries popping up in the Austrian capital. Walk […]
The two bullet casings are already beginning to rust. Sheikh Nasser Pasha plucks them from the ground. “Look, one is from an AK-47, one from an American M-4.” The casings are strewn on the ground atop a long mound of dirt with a few bits of white sticks on it. It would appear unremarkable if one were walking by it. A closer look, however, reveals the white objects are pieces of human bone: arms, legs, and a single human skull. […]
