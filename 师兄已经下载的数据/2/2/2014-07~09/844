Eight people have been executed for terrorism in Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, after their sentences were approved by the Supreme People’s Court.
Innocent lives killed and huge property damage caused. The eight people executed on Saturday were found guilty of crimes including organizing, leading and participating in terrorist groups, murder, arson, and illegal manufacture, storage and transportation of explosives.
These three were convicted for taking part in last summer’s Tiananmen terror attack in Beijing. They drove a vehicle through the iconic square, plowing into a crowd and killing three civilians. 39 others were also injured.
The other five criminals were involved in terror attacks in different parts of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
This man was sentenced to death for attacking two police officers as they were carrying out a raid operation. Using a gun taken from an injured officer, he shot both policemen, then ran away with the gun.
This man was the head of a terrorist cell. Together with other members of his group, he manufactured, stored and transported large amounts of explosives, and trained others on how to use them. He was caught trying to illegally cross the national border while carrying explosive devices.
This man killed a civilian in his home with a knife. It was later discovered that he had been watching extremist videos for months before the murder.
Finally, these two established a terrorist cell several years ago. In 2011, they were responsible for setting fire to two security checkpoints and two police vehicles. And last year, they kidnapped and killed a local government official.
The Chinese government says the executions represent the upholding of justice, and demonstrate their resolution to crackdown on terrorism.
