Anti-graft inspectors have found evidence of corruption among party officials in Xinjiang.
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in statements that inspectors had received strong complaints about graft in the mining, natural resources and land sectors.
Some cadres took bribes, led extravagant lifestyles and held lavish banquets, the CCDI said.
Separate reports were prepared for leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the quasi-military state enterprise that controls much of the region.
The mindset of officials in the corps was to focus on economic development and ignore the fight against corruption, and they had done little to rein in abuses, the statement said. It did not say how many officials were under investigation in Xinjiang or the amounts of money involved.
Anti-graft investigators announced on Friday that a former senior official from the region is to face corruption charges.
Yang Gang, 61, who was a deputy Communist Party secretary for Xinjiang from 2006 to 2010, is accused of taking huge bribes. He became a deputy director of the committee for economic affairs of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year.
Xinjiang is the focus of a massive security crackdown after a series of violent attacks on the mainland that the government has blamed on Muslim separatists from the region.
Zhang Chunxian, Xinjiang's party chief, said the region's authorities would heed the inspection reports and crack down on corruption.
