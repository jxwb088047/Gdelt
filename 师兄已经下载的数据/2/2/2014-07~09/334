Xinjiang teen arrested over fatal attack of imam: Shanghaiist
An 18-year-old man from a village near Kashgar was arrested in connection to the killing of Jume Tahir, the Uyghur imam of China's biggest mosque, state news media reports said.
The suspect, Aini Aishan, was detained in Khotan on accusations of inspiring and planning the fatal July 30 attack on the 74-year-old imam just two days after it occurred, authorities revealed on Sunday.
The imam was reportedly attacked by three men at 6:58 a.m. outside of the 600-year-old Id Kah mosque in Kashgar. Two men were shot dead at the scene by officers and another suspected assailant, 19-year-old Nurmemet Abidili, was detained, The New York Times reports.
The article added that Aishan's family had told him to stop going to mosques that weren't sanctioned by the state, but he ignored their advice.
â€œI know that my parents and wife are in a lot of pain right now. If I had another chance, I would listen to them, take care of my parents and be a good person," he was quoted as saying.
