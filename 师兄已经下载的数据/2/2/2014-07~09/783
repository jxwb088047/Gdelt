Transition in Afghanistan
This paper assesses the threat posed by Uighur extremist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014, and ascertains whether these groups will become a regional threat in the future. The authors outline the state of the Uighur Sunni-jihadist community in both countries, present the available information on their operations and highlight the Chinese domestic and regional responses to the threat. The authors conclude that the future threat from Uighur Sunni-jihadist groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan remains marginal at best.
