Beijing, Jul 29 (EFE).- Dozens of people were killed or wounded in a terrorist attack in Kashgar prefecture in a new episode of violence in China's conflict-ridden northwestern Xinjiang region, the official Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday.
The attack, which was not reported until Tuesday, began on Monday near the police station and other government buildings in the town of Elixku, where a group of people armed with knives carried out a series of assaults.
Later, some of the attackers headed for the nearby town of Huangdi, where they stabbed civilians and destroyed about 30 vehicles, "killing dozens of Uighurs and Han Chinese," police said.
Security forces managed to kill a large number of the dozens of attackers, Xinhua said.
Hundreds of people have died in assorted attacks that Beijing attributes to terrorists and in clashes between the authorities and separatist groups that operate in Xinjiang, a region inhabited by Muslim ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs.
China blames groups associated with jihadism and those seeking to create an independent Eastern Turkestan in Xinjiang for these violent incidents, including the car-bomb attack in a market in Urumqi, the regional capital, last May 22 that killed 39 people and wounded more than 90.
The attack reported on Tuesday coincided with the feast held at the end of Ramadan, a celebration fraught with controversy in China this year after it was announced that the communist regime prohibited some residents of Xinjiang, mainly government officials and children, from undertaking the required daylight fasting during the Muslim holy month.
