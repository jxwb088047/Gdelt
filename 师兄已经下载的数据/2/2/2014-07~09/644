Badiucao (巴丢草): Peace on Trial - China Digital Times (CDT)
As Ilham Tohti awaits a verdict following his trial for separatism this week, Badiucao offers a tribute to the jailed Uyghur scholar in his most recent cartoon contribution to CDT. Ilham Tohti was detained by police from his Beijing home in January, and formally charged with separatism in July. The Uyghur academic had long urged a peaceful inter-ethnic dialogue to mitigate violent conflict in the restive Xinjiang region. In the lead up to the trial, Ilham Tohti had reportedly been shackled, denied food, had photographs and clothing sent by his family withheld, and monitored and verbally abused by Han prisoners.
Read more about Ilham Tohti via CDT. Read also a CDT Q&A with Badiucao in which he discusses his artistic and personal influences. All Badiucao cartoons for CDT are available here. See also exclusive CDT t-shirts with a Badiucao design, for sale on our Zazzle store.
