A waitress at Zombie Burger was told that she would have gotten a tip if she looked “normal.” Taelor May Beeck has pink hair, which appearently isn’t normal enough to get a tip. Cenk Uygur, Hannah Cranston, and Grace Baldridge, hosts of The Young Turks discuss.

Do you think we should abolish tipping? Let us know in the comments below.

Read more here: http://www.rawstory.com/2016/03/iowa-customer-stiffs-zombie-burger-waitress-tips-are-only-for-normal-looking-people/

“A waitress in Iowa said that a customer who stiffed her left a note explaining that tips were only for “normal looking people.”

According to The Des Moines Register, Taelor May Beeck posted a photo of the customer’s receipt to Facebook.

In the area designated to write in a tip amount, the customer wrote, “Tips are only for normal looking people.”

Writing on Facebook, Beeck explained that she wanted to give a shout out “to this girl for stiffing me cuz I look like a weirdo~hope she feels better about herself.”

Description:
When it comes to people, there are those who fade into the sea of endless faces and those who stand out. Whether it is due to talent, a medical condition, an incident from fate, or a deliberate act, there are different variables that can cause people to stand out from the rest of the human population and become famous. The people in this video have had some pretty interesting things happen in their lives. Take Marya Hills as an example, also known as Benshine. She has the largest breasts in the world with a bra size of 32Z. Each breast weighs about 20 pounds and they exist the way that they due thanks to cosmetic surgery. 
Then there is the incredible story of Rolf Buchholz, who is known to be the most pierced man in the world with over 100 piercings on his face and body. Obviously, the act of getting pierced was intentional and deliberate, and it made Rolf famous. But then we have stories like Jonathan Pitre, who has a rare medical condition that causes his entire body to blister inside and out. Every day, the young boy has to wear bandages to keep his skin intact, and the condition he suffers from is known as Epidermolysis Bullos, thus earning the nickname, “Butterfly Boy.”
Then we have grandmothers like Yasmina Rossi, who is 59 years old and has the body of a girl in her mid-20s. Because she takes care of herself with a healthy diet and a homemade body scrub, Y...

A people is a plurality of persons considered as a whole, as in an ethnic group or nation. Collectively, for example, Jews are known as "the Jewish people", European Gypsies comprise the bulk of "the Romani people", and Palestinian Arabs have started to be called "the Palestinian people".
Various republics govern, or claim to govern, in the name of the people. Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term Senatus Populusque Romanus, (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autarchy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome. A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people. Populism is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the common people instead of the elite.
