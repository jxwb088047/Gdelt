Fresh Xinjiang violence blasphemy against Islam - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
Dozens of civilians were killed and injured in a premeditated attack by an armed gang in Xinjiang early Monday. Initial investigation has suggested that it could have been another terrorist attack.
-- The latest attack in southern Xinjiang, largely populated by ethnic Uygur, aims to destabilize the region and spread fear and hatred, as did similar recent attacks.
-- Police shooting dead of the mobsters was decisive and well justified. It prevented more civilian casualties, from both Han and Uygur ethnic groups.
-- The attack came one day ahead of Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan, the holiest month for Muslims. The festival should have been observed in peace, with spiritual reflection and improvement.
-- The attack is against the spirit of Ramadan, which is about the practice of self-discipline and self-control. During Ramadan, devout Muslims refrain from any behavior that could be perceived as sinful, such as swearing, let along slaughtering innocent people.
-- The rioters were committing blasphemy against Islam, "the religion of peace."
-- The attack coincided one of the most important trade fairs in Kashgar, which was widely expected to restore some of the dented investment confidence after previous violence. The latest attack is doomed to hurt the economy.
