Chinese State Media: 17 Miners Trapped Underground - The New Indian Express
BEIJING: China's official news agency says rescuers are working to free 17 miners trapped following a gas explosion at a coal mine in western China.
Xinhua News Agency says the blast happened on Saturday evening. Three other people working inside the mine at the time have been rescued.
Xinhua said Sunday the pit is mined by Dahuangshan Yuxin Coal Mining Co. Ltd., which is owned by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary organization.
China has the world's deadliest mines, although the safety record has been improving in recent years as regulators have strengthened enforcement of safety rules.
A duty officer at Xinjiang work safety bureau said he had no information about the incident.
