The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of the nation's leading commercial banks, will continue financial support for northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, according to an agreement signed on Thursday.
The ICBC will keep its financial support for Xinjiang in four substantial sectors, including major local industries, the Silk Road Economic Belt, urbanization and small and medium enterprises, according to the Strategic Cooperation Agreement on Financial Services inked by ICBC and the regional government.
ICBC will roll out more preferential credit policies, improve services and make best use of local resources to help the region steer its economic development, according to the agreement.
The pact is the second of its kind in the past five years. So far, ICBC has pumped more than 100 billion yuan ($16.24 billion) in loans into the region.
