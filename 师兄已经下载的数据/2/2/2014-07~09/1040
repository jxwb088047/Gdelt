Beijing Attack Terrorists Executed -- Beijing Review
Eight terrorists have been executed with the approval of the Supreme People's Court in Xinjiang, according to the publicity department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Saturday.
Their crimes involved five cases including the terrorist attack in the Tian'anmen Square in Beijing, the gun-seizing and police-assaulting case in Aksu, the illegal manufacturing of explosives and intentional killing case in Kashgar, and the establishment of terrorist organization, murder of government officials and incineration of checkpoint in Hotan.
At noon on October 28, three terrorists drove a jeep into a crowd of people near Tian'anmen Square, killing three innocent people and injuring 39 others. The three suspects died on the spot.
A year-long crackdown on terrorism was launched in China with Xinjiang as the major battleground after a terrorist attack on May 22 in an open market in the regional capital Urumqi. The attack, the deadliest in recent years in the region, killed 39 innocent people and injured 94 others.
On June 5, local courts in Xinjiang sentenced nine people to death, three to suspended death and 69 others to life and fixed-term imprisonment for crimes of organizing, leading or participating in terrorist organizations, intentional homicide and arson.
