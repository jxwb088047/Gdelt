China Is Making Reporting Even Harder For Foreign Journalists
China's government has made conditions for foreign journalists even worse in the past year by restricting where they can travel, according to a recent report by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.
Foreign reporters are "vulnerable to intimidation or worse" if they break these restrictions, and they will be penalized if they write anything that might "displease" the Chinese government, the FCCC's 2014 Working Conditions Survey states. Dozens of foreign journalists reported being barred from Xinjiang and heavily Tibetan areas.
The report, which is based on a survey of the group's 243 members from 31 countries, also said that there has been a "notable increase" in attacks and threats to journalists in China since 2008. Roughly two-thirds of respondents said that they had been victims of "interference, harassment or violence" while on the job.
The country's growing regulations on journalists has made it increasingly difficult for them to do their jobs. Ninety-nine percent of FCCC members said that conditions for reporters in China are not up to international standards, and 80 percent said that conditions have gotten worse or stayed the same since May 2013.
The situation is grim for domestic reporters in China as well. In July, the Chinese government warned journalists not to collaborate with any foreign media outlets.
