Chinese minority Uyghur scholar accused of separatism goes on trial | GlobalPost
A prominent scholar of China's Uyghur ethnic minority accused of advocating independence for the country's restive Xinjiang region went on trial Wednesday amid a stepped-up crackdown on what Beijing says is terrorism committed by separatists.
Ilham Tohti, who formerly taught economics at Minzu University of China in Beijing, is known as a moderate critic of the government's policies in the far-western region divided between Uyghurs, a Muslim Turkic-speaking people, and Han Chinese, the country's dominant ethnic group.
Since Tohti was detained in January, the European Union, the United States and international rights groups have called for his release.
Tohti has denied any wrongdoing and involvement in separatism, according to his lawyers.
"My father was not arrested and imprisoned for doing anything criminal," Tohti's daughter Jewher Ilham said Tuesday on her Twitter account. "He was imprisoned because he stood up and spoke out for his people, because he called for the equality of nationalities."
"My father is not an advocate of violence! My father had no thought of splitting the country! My father is innocent," she said.
If the Urumqi Intermediate People's Court finds him guilty, critics say that Chinese authorities could face stronger criticism from home and abroad over their repressive governing style.
Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the prosecution of the scholar is "a disturbing example of politicized show trials and intolerance for peaceful criticism" that "only serves to deepen perceptions of discrimination" against Uyghurs.
