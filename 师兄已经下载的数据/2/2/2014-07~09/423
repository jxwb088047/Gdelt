China admits true death toll in Xinjiang terror attack | The Times

An eruption of violence in the far-western region of Xinjiang resulted in the 
deaths of more than 40 people - a far higher toll than the authorities 
originally admitted, Chinese state media said today. 


The same reports said that last Sunday’s bloodshed began with an “organised 
and serious” terrorist bombing attack in a part of the country that is home 
to China’s Muslim Uighur minority and which Beijing fears is falling under 
the influence of Islamic militancy. At least half of the deaths appear to 
have been Uighurs shot dead in the aftermath of the initial bombings.
