More violence in China's Xinjiang after deadly attack - bdnews24.com
State media 
said a gang armed with knives first attacked a police station and government 
offices on Monday in the town of Elixku, in Shache county, about 200 km (125 
miles) from the old Silk Road city of Kashgar in China's far west.Some 
moved on to the nearby town of Huangdi, attacking civilians and smashing and 
setting fire to six vehicles, in what the official Xinhua news agency called an 
"organised and premeditated terrorist attack"."Police officers at the 
scene shot dead dozens of members of the mob," the brief report 
said.Xinjiang, home to many Turkic-language speaking Uighurs, has been 
beset by violence for years, which the government blames on Islamist militants 
or separatists who it says are bent on establishing an independent state called 
East Turkestan.There were indications that unrest had spread by 
Wednesday to Kashgar, a popular tourist site especially during the 
summer.A French traveller said he saw a body lying in a pool of blood 
outside the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar's old town on Wednesday morning, and armed 
police pouring into the city by afternoon."We heard shouting and my 
friend saw two people running away with knives. Police came quickly and told 
people not to take pictures. They checked mobile phones," he told Reuters by 
telephone.He added that it was the reasons for the violence were unclear 
and he could not tell if those involved were Uighur or members of China's 
majority Han ethnicity.When leaving Kashgar on Wednesday, the traveller 
said a long convoy of armed police vehicles, including at least five armoured 
personnel carriers, drove into the city."All cars coming into Kashgar 
were being turned around," he said."These were urban tanks with machine 
guns, not water cannon," another European citizen accompanying him 
said.DELAY IN REPORTING VIOLENCEState media only reported the 
attacks in Shache, also known by its Uighur name of Yarkant, late on 
Tuesday.It is not clear why there was a delay, though China's ruling 
Communist Party, which values stability above all else, has a habit of 
suppressing or delaying bad news.Reuters could not reach the Xinjiang 
government for comment despite repeated attempts.The government has yet 
to give a full account of what happened, or a death toll."Uighurs in 
Shache said excessive use of armed suppression led to conflict in which nearly 
100 people were killed or injured," Dilxat Raxit, a World Uyghur Congress 
spokesman, said in an email, adding that he could not confirm the 
figure."The Chinese government must transparently let the world know the 
facts of this situation," he added.The attack took place at the end of 
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which officials had tried to get Muslims in 
Xinjiang to ignore, in an indication of what rights groups say is discrimination 
targeting the Uighurs.Shache is located in Xinjiang's heavily Uighur 
southwestern part, close to the borders of Tajikistan, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan.Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the 
government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have 
provoked unrest, a claim Beijing denies.China exercises tight control 
over Xinjiang, making visits by foreign reporters there to independently assess 
the situation extremely difficult.Xinjiang, resource-rich and 
strategically located on the borders of central Asia, is crucial to meeting 
China's growing energy needs.Exiles, rights groups and many foreign 
experts say that most of the proceeds have gone to the Han Chinese, stoking 
resentment among Uighurs.More than 200 people have died in unrest in 
Xinjiang in the past year or so, the government says, prompting a tough 
crackdown by Beijing.Violence blamed by China on Uighur extremists has 
begun to spread outside of Xinjiang. In March, 29 people were stabbed to death 
at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming.
