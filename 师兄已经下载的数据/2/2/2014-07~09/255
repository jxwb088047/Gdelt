gulftoday.ae | Chinese minority scholar indicted for separatism


 BEIJING: An outspoken Chinese minority scholar was indicted on separatism charges on Wednesday amid a renewed flare-up of bloody anti-government violence in the country’s far west.The prosecutor’s office in the Xinjiang regional capital of Urumqi announced the indictment of economics professor Ilham Tohti in a brief online statement.Tohti was detained in mid-January and later accused of separatism. Through his lawyer, he has firmly rejected accusations of advocating Xinjiang’s independence from China. Such charges almost always end in conviction and a sentence of up to several years in prison.Tohti was originally accused of recruiting followers through a website he founded to allegedly manufacture rumours, distort and play-up incidents, spread separatist thoughts, incite ethnic hatred and engage in separatist activities.He is also accused of telling his students that minority Uighurs should emulate Chinese who violently resisted Japanese invaders in World War II, and of teaching them to hate China and seek to overthrow the government.Calls to Tohti’s lawyer, Li Fangping, rang unanswered on Wednesday night.Tohti is widely considered a moderate but vocal advocate of equal rights for the Turkic Uighur (pronounced WEE-gur) ethnic minority in Xinjiang. Many Uighurs say they face repressive cultural and religious policies along with economic disenfranchisement in their homeland.Such sentiments are seen as contributing to a recent increase in violence in Xinjiang blamed on Uighur militants that has also spread to Beijing and the western province of Yunnan.On Monday, the government said rampaging militants armed with knives and axes killed or injured dozens of people in Shache county near the city of Kashgar in Xinjiang’s far west. Official reports said police killed dozens of the assailants, who reportedly first attacked police and government offices before turning on civilians. More details haven’t been released and the precise death toll remains unknown.China called the incident a “premeditated terror attack,” and said further investigations were underway. If dozens were indeed killed, it would be the bloodiest single outbreak of violence since ethnic riots in Urumqi in 2009 left nearly 200 dead, according to the government.The official account of Monday’s incident has been disputed by a Uighur group based in the US, where many Uighurs live.Associated Press
