A Horse With No Name

On the first part of the journey, 
I was looking at all the life. 
There were plants and birds. and rocks and things, 
There was sand and hills and rings. 
The first thing I met, was a fly with a buzz, 
And the sky, with no clouds. 
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry, 
But the air was full of sound. 

I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
It felt good to be out of the rain.
In the desert you can remember your name, 
\'Cause there ain\'t no one for to give you no pain. 
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la

After two days, in the desert sun, 
My skin began to turn red. 
After three days, in the desert fun, 
I was looking at a river bed. 
And the story it told, of a river that flowed, 
Made me sad to think it was dead. 

You see I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
It felt good to be out of the rain. 
In the desert you can remember your name, 
\'Cause there ain\'t no one for to give you no pain. 
La la, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la
La la, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la

After nine days, I let the horse run free, 
\'Cause the desert had turned to sea. 
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things, 
There was sand and hills and rings. 
The ocean is a desert, with its life underground, 
And a perfect disguise above. 
Under the cities lies, a heart made of ground, 
But the humans will give no love. 

You see I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
It felt good to be out of the rain. 
In the desert you can remember ...

Call of Duty Online in AMERICA!? It might be going GLOBAL!

Nifty Things Down Here: ▼

CALL OF DUTY ONLINE MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE TO PLAY!!!

Even though this information has been around for nearly half a week since this video’s upload date (and I tweeted about it the day of), I still wanted to share this amazing news with you guys!

Activision is looking to hire a Director of Product Management to manage a team of people who will work on the global expansion of Call of Duty Online. THAT’S FUCKING INSANE! Here’s the link: https://activision.jibeapply.com/activision/jobs/OPE000069/Santa-Monica-California-Director-Product-Management?lang=en-US

They could have chosen to be more specific about which regions they want to expand Call of Duty Online to (i.e. United States, Canada, UK, etc.), but the fact that it says global expansion means that they could be working on making Call of Duty Online the biggest and most accessible Call of Duty game ever!

This game has a TON of potential, and I’m glad that Activision is fully realizing it. If only I could get the Chinese version working…lol

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where...
