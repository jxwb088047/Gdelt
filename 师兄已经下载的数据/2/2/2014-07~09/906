Nine more killed in East Turkestan | Asia-Pacific | Worldbulletin News
NineÂ people were shot dead and one captured in China's restive far western region of Xinjiang (East Turkestan) on Friday, state media said, the latest bout of violence in a week in which dozens have been killed there.
The official People's Daily said on its microblog that the incident happened in Hotan in Xinjiang's far south, when more than 30,000 civilians involved in a counter-terror operation with police discovered "signs" a terror gang was operating.
"Police and the 30,000 civilians in unison surrounded the terror gang, and nine of them were shot dead and one detained," the newspaper said.
No police or civilians were injured in the operation, it added, without providing further details.
China usually uses terms like "terror gang" to describe Uighurs.
Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, who speak a Turkic language, has been beset for years by violence which Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies , including controls on Islam, have provoked.
Hundreds have been killed in Xinjiang in the past year and a half, and the past few days have seen a series of deadly incidents, including the murder of a prominent imam at a major mosque in the old Silk Road city of Kashgar.
State media reported on Wednesday that a gang armed with knives had attacked a police station and government offices on Monday in the town of Elixku, in Shache county.
The government said dozens of knife-wielding attackers were shot dead in Shache but has yet to give a full account of what happened in the county, which lies 200 km (125 miles) from Kashgar. Police appeared to be on high alert on Wednesday, pouring into Kashgar and closing off roads.
