China explosions kill at least two people - ITV News
Several explosions in China's western region have killed at least two people and injured many others, according to Chinese state media.
The blasts happened in at least three places of Luntai county, according to the Tianshan news portal, which is run by the regional branch of the Communist Party.
"Public security officers quickly handled the situation," it said, without giving details.
The brief statement said the unspecified number of injured had been taken to hospital and an investigation was under way.
Luntai county is in central Xinjiang, 220 miles south-west of the capital, Urumqi.
Xinjiang has experienced rising unrest in recent months blamed on militants from the region's native Muslim Turkic Uighur ethnic group seeking to overthrow Chinese rule.
