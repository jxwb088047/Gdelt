50 killed in Sunday's Xinjiang explosions, Chinese media say: Shanghaiist
The death toll from a series of explosions set off in Xinjiang this weekend has climbed to 50, Chinese media reported yesterday, adding that 40 assailants were killed in the attack.
This is a significant increase in casualties compared to initial reports from regional authorities who earlier said that the explosions in Luntai county on Sunday killed two people.
The attacks happened just days before the prominent Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life in prison over charges of separatism. The EU, US, United Nations and numerous human rights groups have all called on the release of Ilham, who's seen as a moderate voice. Critics believe that the conviction could further increase tensions in the restive Xinjiang region, while Chinese state media have applauded the turnout as a victory in China's newly launched war on terror.
Sunday's explosions are the most recent in a string of deadly attacks in Xinjiang. In May, nearly 40 people were killed and over 90 more injured in a series of bomb attacks at an open market in the regional capital Urumqi.
China blames ongoing unrest in the region on terrorists, separatists and extremists seeking independence, while rights groups say the violence is a response to discrimination and oppressive religious controls put in place by Beijing.
