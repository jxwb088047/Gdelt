The murder of Jume Tahir, the imam of China's largest mosque in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has stirred widespread anger among Muslims. Shortly after his murder on Wednesday morning, police were able to track down three suspects. Two of them, armed with knives and axes, were shot dead by police as they resisted arrest. Another suspect was detained.
According to police, the three suspects, influenced by religious extremism, planned to "do something big" to increase their influence after killing the 74-year-old religious leader Wednesday morning. People from all walks of life and ethnic groups in Xinjiang have condemned the murder.
Ma Jinguo, Akhond of West Bridge Temple, said, “Jume Tahir was knowledgeable, respected, incorruptible. He was an Imam who enjoyed a high reputation among Muslims nationwide. I’m extremely angry about the murder and extremely sad over losing such a good Imam.”
Mullah Abdurekep, President of Xinjiang Islamic Scripture College, said, “The Quran teaches us that killing one innocent is equivalent to killing everyone in the society.... I want the terrorists to stop immediately and not create public panic... No one should be used or fooled by the terrorists... We should love and protect our religious leaders, and carry out legitimate religious activities within the party and the country’s law, and not carry out illegal religious activities.”
Liu Yajing, Secretary of Heijiashanhoujie Community, said, "Terrorist attacks will not affect us. No matter what they do, they will not destroy the atmosphere of unity and harmony among people of different ethnic groups."
