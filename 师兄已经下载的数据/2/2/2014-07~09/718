Workers flock to Xinjiang cotton harvest[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn
A train carrying migrant workers from Central China's Henan province is ready to head for Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the country's biggest cotton production base, on Aug 25. The train, which was scheduled to arrive about 50 hours later, was carrying seasonal workers heading for cotton picking season in Xinjiang. The harvest usually lasts from September to November, attracting a large number of migrant workers from across China, especially from Henan province, one of the country's major labor force exporters.
