A total of 858 violations of Communist Party austerity measures were uncovered in Xinjiang during the first half of the year, with 87 per cent of the cases found in the second quarter, the region's anti-graft watchdog has said.
The findings coincided with just-completed inspections by the more senior Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's top anti-graft agency, carried out between March to May. Only 110 violations were found in the first quarter.
Xinjiang's anti-graft agency said 1,327 cadres had been punished for the violations, according to its statement carried on the CCDI website.
The main problem area for Xinjiang was abuse of taxpayers' money for banquets and luxury gifts. Other excesses included unnecessary ceremonies and misuse of government vehicles.
Xinjiang and Jiangxi, with 847 violations, were the only two areas CCDI investigated for six months and which were flagged up on its website.
Over the weekend, the CCDI inspection team publicly issued separate reports on Xinjiang's regional authorities and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps - a quasi-military entity that controls much of the region. The inspectors said they had received substantial complaints of graft in the mining, natural resources and land sectors.
A CCDI inspection report issued yesterday said the main issues for Fujian were "naked" officials (those whose families live abroad), corrupt land deals and collusion with businessmen.
