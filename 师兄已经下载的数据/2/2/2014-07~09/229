Xinjiang villagers condemn terror ringleader - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
Villagers in Shache county, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, have spoken out to condemn the man who allegedly led a terror attack on July 28 that killed 37 civilians, and have expressed support for the crackdown on terrorism.
Qasim Hushur, the imam of a mosque in Elixku township, Shache county of Kashgar prefecture, said Nuramat Sawut had committed an unforgivable crime.
The imam said Sawut was a quiet man and villagers did not expect he would do such things, the Xinjiang Daily reported Wednesday.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that Sawut incited hundreds of people armed with knives and axes to attack government offices and a police station in the early morning of July 28. They killed a total of 37 civilians and injured another 13, and also smashed 31 vehicles and burned six.
Police shot 59 terrorists dead and arrested another 215 during the violent attack.
A villager in Shache said that Sawut used to be the imam of a mosque but was removed from the position in 2008. No one supported him because his religious knowledge was too shallow and he neither respected senior citizens nor cared about children, the villager said.
Other villagers said he had no friends and only got along with his three brothers, who participated in this terror attack. He even used a fake name, the Xinjiang Daily reported.
Sawut was reported to have had close connections with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Police said he had been gathering people under the cover of Ramadan meals in July, to prepare terrorist activities .
Chinese Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun vowed to crack down on terrorists during his third inspection tour to Xinjiang on August 1 to 4. Guo said the crackdown "should reach every village and household."
Authorities on Wednesday offered a 750,000 yuan ($121,706) reward for 87 individuals and 10 collectives in Xinhe county, Akesu Prefecture, who contributed to the arrest of the mobs.
A year-long anti-terror campaign was launched in May. In June, 32 gangs were busted, 380 suspects apprehended and 315 people convicted.
