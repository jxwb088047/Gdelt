Muslim Students in Xinjiang Face Expulsion for Observing Ramadan | Morocco World News
Tinejdad, Morocco- Following the ban on fasting during Ramadan imposed by the Chinese government on Muslims in the province of Xinjiang, Kashgar Normal College,  located in the far west province of Xinjiang, has issued a memo warning Muslim Uyghur students  to be expelled if they fast during Ramadan.
According to Radio Free Asia, the Kashgar Normal College “warned ethnic minority Muslim Uyghur students who fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan that they may be expelled.”
In an attempt to discourage Muslim Uyghur students in the college to observe the holy month of Ramadan, the administration of Kashgar Normal College “distributes bottles of water and free food to Muslim students,” and has ordered all food outlets near the campus to close during the Iftar time.
“Our college administration strictly forbids fasting and other Ramadan practises by Uyghur students,” a Uyghur student told Radio Free Asia.“It is clear to us that those who refuse to eat will be warned of expulsion from the college or be deprived of their diplomas,” he said.
Despite the restrictions imposed by the college to eradicate Islamic practices, several Muslim students defied the college new policies and refused to stop their fasting traditions
“Although there are strict rules and their activities are closely monitored, some of the Uyghur students continue to secretly fast,” the student said.
Several days after the Chinese government’s ban, Uyghur Muslims defied the authorities started observing Ramadan and regularly performing their prayers, stating defiantly that “the restrictions have backfired.”
The tight restrictions on religious freedom in Xinjiang has stirred controversy and the ban runs counter to the expectations of the Chinese authorities.
