U.S. lambasts North Korea on religious freedom | GlobalPost
The United States blasted North Korea for its dismal record on religious freedom on Monday, alleging the frequent arrest, torture, and killing of those belonging to religious groups unsanctioned by the government.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, at a press conference to release the 2013 Report on International Religious Freedom, harshly criticized Pyongyang for its "absolute and brutal repression of religious activity."
The State Department report raised concerns about the "extremely harsh penalties" frequently dealt to people of faith inside North Korea who engage with foreigners or missionaries, including execution. It said 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners were languishing in remote prison camps, some of whom were detained for "religious reasons."
The report also noted the North's increased police efforts to halt religious activity at the border it shares with China, according to accounts by former government security agents who defected to South Korea.
On China, the report raised concerns about social discrimination of Uyghur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, noting continued "particularly serious violations of religious freedom" in Tibetan areas and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
It raised instances of ethnic Uyghurs being labeled as "terrorists" and shot inside their homes or places of worship by security forces, citing information from human rights groups.
On Myanmar, the report acknowledged some improvement of religious freedom as a result of economic and social reforms put in place by the government, but expressed concerns over continued incidents of violence against Muslims.
