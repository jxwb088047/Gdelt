Eight persons were wounded on Thursday night in yet another knife-attack in southern China's Guangdong Province, allegedly carried out by a 32-year-old mentally deranged man.

The man surnamed Fan is from Shaoyang City of central China's Hunan Province, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Local police said the assailant was arrested with help of people at the scene.

Witness Luo Xianggui, whose husband is among the injured, said the assailant lived across the street and showed no oddness during daily contacts.
