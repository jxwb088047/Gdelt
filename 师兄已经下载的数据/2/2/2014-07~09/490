Twinning sisters Haley and Emily Ferguson raised a few eyebrows for being essentially the same person and both trying to win that coveted rose from Ben on The Bachelor, but they’ve met their match. A different set of twins appeared on an Australian talk show called The Insight to reveal that they not only only look alike, they share the same boyfriend.

According to Esquire, 30-year-old sisters Anna and Lucy DeCinque live with their boyfriend, who is a fraternal twin, in the same room in their mom’s house and it works for them. \"We\'ve had separate boyfriends before, but they didn\'t understand our closeness. Ben understands we want to be together all the time,\" one of them (we nor the show are sure who) said. The unidentified twin added, \"He understands the twin thing and the very close bond we have with each other.\" Apparently, \"too close for comfort\" is a nonexistent phrase in their world.

In order to remain looking exactly alike, the women have spent almost $250,000 on cosmetic surgeries over the last decade, Perth Now reports. That dedication even extends to fertility. Pregnancy might not be on the to do list yet but they’ve already got a plan on how to handle it when it does come up. \"We would have to be exactly the same—even if we went through IVF at the same time,\" they told the publication.

An odd situation like this is bound to garner a strong internet reaction and they’ve already received their fair share of insults. However, they’re taking it all in stride. \"We are happy with our lives. That’s how we want to live and we are not hurting anybody,\" they said.

Living With Tigers: Family Share Home With Pet Tigers

SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj

A BRAZILIAN family have taken the trend for exotic pets to new extremes. Not content with the standard pooch or moggy, the Borges brood have been sharing their home with a pack of SEVEN tigers. Aryas Borges, began his love affair with tigers when he found two of the big cats living in a bad state at a circus -- and decided to bring them home. His daughters Nayara, 20, Uyara, 23, and Deusanira, 24, grew up sharing their meals, beds and playtime with the fully-grown predators and walking them on a leash. And Nayara, a real-life female Tarzan, regularly hops into the family swimming pool to take a dip with her furry friends. After his success with the rescue tigers, Ary started breeding them, and the tigers still have the run of the house at the Borges family home in Maringa. The family have forged an incredible bond with the tigers after living under the same roof for so long.
