Qatar is building two  centres in the Xinjiang province of China to protect the environment and wildlife -  one for the propagation of the Saker falcon (white and blond), and the other for breeding  Asian Houbara bustard.  
HE the Minister of Environment  Ahmed Amer Mohamed al-Humaidi met  a delegation from the  Xinjiang province  in Doha to discuss the projects.
The Minister said: “The State of Qatar has great interest and care for the environment, especially those items that have great value in the heritage of the Gulf and Qatar such as Saker (falcons).
The two projects form part of  Qatar’s 2030 vision, which aims at protecting the nature and endangered wildlife and their natural habitats, the Minister noted.  
During the foundation-laying ceremony at the two projects, the Xinjiang province environment minister thanked HH the Emir, the government and people of Qatar for their efforts to preserve the environment.  
“The establishment of these two centres, which will have a positive impact in maintaining the sustainability of these types of birds is critical for the protection of rare species threatened with extinction on a global level,” he said, adding that all the studies and research that will take place in these centres in the future will contribute directly to the enrichment of knowledge for several generations to come.
