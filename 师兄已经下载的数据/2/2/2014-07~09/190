Pro-Beijing Imam Stabbed To Death In China's Xinjiang Region
The imam of China's biggest mosque in the western region of Xinjiang has been killed in what appears to be a targeted assassination, media reports citing officials said Thursday.
According to the Chinese media, 74-year-old Jume Tahir was stabbed to death after he led early morning prayers at the Id Kah mosque in the city of Kashgar on Wednesday.
Tahir, a member Xinjiang's mainly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, was appointed imam of the 600-year-old mosque by China's ruling Communist Party. It is still not clear why he was murdered.
Media reports indicated that he was unpopular among the local Muslim population for backing the Chinese government's policies.
Notably, the development comes just two days after dozens of people were killed and many more injured in a "terrorist attack" by knife-wielding assailants in the Xinjiang region.
The Xinjiang region has witnessed several such large-scale violence in recent years, including the July 2009 Uighur unrest that left more than 200 people dead and over 1,700 injured.
Uighurs are members of a minority Turkic Muslim ethnic group which constitutes about eight million of Xinjiang's 20 million population.
They often complain that the influx of Han Chinese migrants to Xinjiang in their quest for better prospects has marginalized the Uighur culture in the province.
Nevertheless, China views the Uighur unrest as part of attempts to establish an independent state with the support of certain Central Asian countries.
