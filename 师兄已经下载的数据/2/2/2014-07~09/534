Police in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has detained a man for spreading online rumors about a terrorist attack in the region's Shache County that resulted in the deaths of 37 civilians.
A 22-year-old identified as Ababakram apparently forwarded a post found on a foreign website, saying that police have killed all the children and women chanting scriptures at a mosque.
He also added that the largest massacre ever was underway.
After being detained, he admitted he made up the whole thing.
"After hearing that many people were killed in three villages, I exaggerated on purpose. I thought if a village has 500 to 600 residents, then 3,000 to 5,000 people could be killed in three villages. I didn't see police cars. I made up all of that to make things sound more sensational."
He has also faked details about armed police bombarding villages.
"When I rewrote the story, I thought it was not so attractive. So I added the part that the three villages were bombarded, women and children were among the victims."
The police found 12 terror videos along with hundreds of related audio recordings and ebooks on the suspect's laptop.
Ababakram says last year he happened to come into contact with foreign websites promoting religious extremism and inciting hatred among different ethnic groups.
