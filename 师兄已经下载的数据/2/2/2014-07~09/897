China launched a year-long campaign against terrorism, with Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the center, after a terrorist attack on May 22 in an open market in the regional capital Urumqi. Tens of thousands of residents have contributed to the campaign. They do their part to report any suspicions of terrorist activity, and work with local officials to subdue the terrorists.
Amidst the tranquility of in Aksu in west of Xinjiang, an anti-terrorist campaign is brewing.
In response to several terrorist attacks made from July 7th to 9th in the region, local residents have mobilized themselves to stem attacks before its too late.
More than 400 here have joined the hunt after a tip off from sources indicate that terror suspects may be lurking in a area near corn fields. Even as the sweltering summer heat tips 40 degrees Celsius, they stay on guard.
"We hope we can catch them. We will fight with them and we are not afraid. It’s everybody’s duty to subdue terrorists," A local villager said.
More than 80-percent of local villagers have taken part in the anti-terrorists campaign. Residents say they are motivated to guard against intrusions that will disrupt peace.
"These terrorists destroyed our life. We hate them. We will beat them if we find them," A local villager said.
Though no suspects were found in this round of search, others had been captured at the local grassroots level.This particular suspect who was cornered by locals, clearly had underestimated their efforts.
"I thought only the police can capture us. Now, I understand that everybody hates terrorism, and they will unite to fight," A suspect said.

These men had attacked government offices and a police station on July 28 in Shache county in southern Xinjiang, killing 37 civilians.
