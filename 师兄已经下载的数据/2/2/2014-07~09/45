Series of Explosions Rattle China's Xinjiang | News | teleSUR English
China's north-west province of Xinjiang has been hit by at least three explosions, killing two people. 
 
 
 
 
 

Dozens more were injured in the series of blasts on Sunday, which hit three towns on the edge of the Taklamakan desert. 
 
 
 
 
 

Chinese authorities say they have restored order in the province, and the wounded are receiving treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 

Xinjiang has been the site of numerous clashes between Chinese authorities and the indigenous Uyghur people. 
 
 
 
 
 

Beijing has accused the Uyghur independence movement of carrying out terrorist attacks against government offices and ethnic Han. However, independence advocates say Chinese security forces are systematically repressing Uyghurs. 
 
 
 
 
 

Violence in the province has been on the rise in recent months. Nearly 100 people were killed in the city of Kashgar in July, amid clashes between Uyghur protesters and security forces. 
 
 
 
 
 

State media outlet Xinhua described the July incident as a “terrorist attack,” and reported that local authorities believe the violence was premeditated. 
 
 
 
 
 

Uyghur groups said the violence was provoked by security forces, who they accused of cracking down on critics of Beijing. 
 
 
 
 
 

Days after the clashes, the imam of the Kashgar mosque was killed in what human rights groups have called a targeted assassination.
