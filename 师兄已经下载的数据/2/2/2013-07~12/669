Standard Digital News - Kenya : Tiananmen crash: Xinjiang security tightened
XINJIANG, CHINA: Security appears to have been increased in China's Xinjiang region, a day after police said they had detained five suspects over the Tiananmen crash.
A car crashed into a crowd and burst into flames at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Monday, killing all three in the car and two bystanders.

The suspects all appear to be from the restive western region of Xinjiang, home to China's Muslim Uighur minority.

Some of Xinjiang's Muslim Uighur group complain of cultural and religious repression under Beijing's rule and there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence. China says it grants the Uighurs wide-ranging freedoms.

Monday's crash, which happened around midday at the northern end of Tiananmen Square near an entrance to the Forbidden City, left 38 people injured.
Police said that the jeep was driven by a man who was with his wife and mother. They had ignited petrol inside the car, they added.

The five suspects believed to be connected to the incident were arrested 10 hours after the crash, police said.

"This is the first time that violent terrorist forces from Xinjiang have caused a serious incident in Beijing," state-controlled newspaper Global Times said on Thursday.

"The inland people need to step up vigilance," it said, adding: "People from Xinjiang, especially the Uighurs will be the biggest victims."

State-run China Daily described those behind the attack as "religious extremists". "What they have done is against the interests and will of the majority of Uighurs, who have benefited from the unity of the country," it said.
