Pakistan-China enjoy strategic relationship,Fatemi | Pakistan News
Islamabad ,Syed Tariq Fatemi, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) while speaking to the visiting Television team of Xinjiang Television stated that both Pakistan and China enjoy a strategic relationship.
The ties are time tested and deep rooted in areas of commerce, economy, cultural, defence and people to people contacts.
The SAPM stated that the new leaderships in both the countries have the same vision for enhancing bilateral cooperation. The development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a matter of high priority for both sides.
Work on the project is in full swing.  The corridor envisages connectivity, development of rail and road links, fiber optic cable, energy projects and development of special economic zones.
The corridor is a historic project which would trace the prints of old “Silk Route” and will connect China with Pakistan and onwards with Central Asia and East Europe.
It would not only benefit and bring prosperity to both countries but also generate economic activity, peace and stability to the people of the whole region.
He said that friendship with China is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy. The growing quantum of interaction between the two countries reflects the positive desire of both sides to further reinforce the existing brotherly and time-tested China-Pakistan relationship to new heights.
He reaffirmed the strong commitment of the Prime Minister to further deepen and fortify the bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
Presently, a fourteen member delegation of Xinjiang Television is visiting Pakistan for making a documentary on “New Journey on the Silk Road”, with special emphasis on “Sino-Pakistan Friendship” and “China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”.
