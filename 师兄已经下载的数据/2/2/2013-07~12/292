China police station attack leaves 11 dead - News - JamaicaObserver.com

XINJIANG, China - Nine axe-wielding assailants have been shot dead during an attack on a police station in China's volatile western Xinjiang province, authorities have said.

It is reported that two auxiliary police officers died in Saturday's clashes.

Another two policemen were injured, the authorities say. Xinjiang - where Muslim Uighurs make up a large part of the population - has seen several clashes this year.

Last month, five people died when a car ploughed into a crowd in Beijing's Tiananmen Square - an attack the authorities blamed on the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).
