During Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent trip to Central Asia, the concept of building a "Silk Road Economic Belt" with Central Asian countries became a buzzword in China.Xi proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt when addressing Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan on September 7, defining it as a platform for closer regional cooperation. He called on countries in Central Asia to strengthen mutual political trust, establish a stable and long-term relationship in energy cooperation, expand cooperation in non-resource areas, and raise the volume of trade, with a series of large-scale projects being finalized.China has long been attempting to build an economic corridor that connects the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which neighbors eight countries in Asia, with other Central Asian countries.People from across the public spectrum in Xinjiang, from students to scholars, are discussing how the region could upgrade its industries and boost its development by leveraging the opportunity of the economic belt.Businessmen are upbeat about the economic belt, keen on the possibilities a more connected Xinjiang would offer for investment in special economic zones, despite the occasional violent attacks in its southern regions. Academics are striving to analyze the potential and positioning of Xinjiang's development."The economic belt proposed by President Xi has built up confidence for the take-off of the region. The signals sent out by our top leader have assured the market that Xinjiang will become an important base for natural resources, as well as becoming influential for China's opening-up," Turgunjan Tursun, an associate research fellow of the Institute of Sociology with the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.The path that connects Xinjiang with the outside world would open up and prosper if leaders in both central and local governments seize opportunities and remain alert to possibilities, Turgunjan noted.

Strained development Subject to its location in the far west of China, Xinjiang has lagged behind for a long time. Back in the 1980s, China implemented the opening-up and reform policy but Xinjiang remained somewhat forgotten.To develop its frontier, the Chinese central government in 1999 announced its "Go West" campaign, encouraging people nationwide to aid the construction of the west. However, a lack of convenience for transport, poor infrastructure, and low education levels have long impeded the economic development of the region and blocked the improvement of people's livelihoods.But many are now upbeat about the fervor which seems to have gripped the region.Within months, Ashanjang suddenly found that scaffolds and cranes darkened the Kashi skyline. "The city is now occupied by construction sites. Everywhere is under construction," Ashanjang, who was born in Kashi and now working in a State-owned grain enterprise in Urumqi, told the Global Times.He could barely recognize some of the streets after leaving home for months. "It changes almost every day," Ashanjang said.What Ashanjang saw barely scratches the surface of the development of Xinjiang in recent years. In order to accelerate the local economy, China has invested tens of billions of yuan in forming Xinjiang as the country's new window for opening-up, using the model of Shenzhen as an example.To achieve this goal, the central government decided to build two economic zones in Kashi and in Horgos, aiming to position both cities as focal points of growth in 2010.Three years have gone by. The development of the two economic zones has been shaping up and bringing in business."Let me tell you how fast this place is changing. One month ago, when I shopped online and asked for my goods to be delivered to Kashi, they refused, saying delivery companies did not have offices here. But now, there are a dozen delivery companies in Kashi," Tang Xiaoli, general manager of Xinjiang branch office for Beijing Hongxin Investment Company, told the Global Times.After visiting Kashi several times, Tang signed an agreement of 2.1 billion yuan ($342.93 million) with the local government, covering a real estate project, drug research, a door and window factory and micro-credit loan and bonding company."We have seen tremendous potential in Kashi, especially after the railway between Xinjiang and Pakistan begins being built," Tang said.China and Pakistan are still discussing the rail link between Kashi and Gwadar, a new port in Pakistan.Most interviewees contacted by the Global Times gave a positive assessment about the development of Xinjiang after Xi pitched the concept of building the economic belt, considering its unique geological location, vast territory and small population."By using the opportunity of the economic belt, we could benefit our local farmers along the path that connected Xinjiang with central Asian countries," Liu, manager of Sunshine Desert, a local essential oils company, told the Global Times.

Room to grow"Xinjiang's comparatively less developed situation has left a huge space to boost local economy by attracting investment in and out of China," Luo Lijian, chairman of Haoyuan Environment Protection Company, told the Global Times.Luo has invested billions of yuan to develop real estate and a wastewater treatment plant in Kashi."The real estate prices are comparatively low here, at less than 3,000 yuan per square meter. Prices will rise soon with the China-Pakistan Railway," Li told the Global Times.In Chen Weiqiang's eyes, Kashi's development depends on the structure of industrial layout of the economic zone. "We are positioning Kashi as a base for new industries, including finance, innovative industries and environmental-friendly to upgrade the industrial structure," Chen Weiqiang, director of the Office of the Special Economic Zone in Xinjiang, told the Global Times."The economic belt potentially connects billions of people and offers huge opportunities. Xinjiang, as the forefront of this new open zone, is transiting from the geological center of Asia to its transportation hub and economic cooperation center. It would benefit all the countries if they seized the opportunities being presented here," Chen told the Global Times.In order to attract businessmen, the central and local governments have implemented at least ten preferential policies, including tax exemptions, subsidized electricity and transportation rates, low-interest loans for infrastructure projects and construction of better rail and air links with neighboring countries.Earlier this month, Kashi's general plan of building a 50-square-kilometer economic zone was approved by the State Council and has already attracted 2.43 billion yuan in investment from 34 projects, while Horgos is focusing on becoming a base for the transportation of mineral resources, mainly gas and oil.Started back in 2009, the gas pipeline that connects Horgos with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan has already become one of the most important energy resource channels for China. A total of 47.77 billion cubic meters of gas had already been transported from central Asia to China by February, according to statistics from the Horgos management commission.In the recent 3rd China-Eurasia Expo held in Urumqi this month, companies from over 50 countries and regions took part. Official statistics from the Expo showed the transaction volume of foreign economic and trade had reached $5.6 billion.Xi also called on the nations attending the Expo to work to improve traffic connectivity, in order to open up a strategic regional path from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea, and gradually connect Eastern, Western and Southern Asia.Academics agree transport routes will make or break Xinjiang's success, especially as it lacks a port. With rich natural resources, the lack of basic infrastructure has become a hurdle for the development of central Asia. As such, developing a reliable transportation network in some of the world's most inhospitable territory is of paramount importance.Safety hurdlesSafety and stability do remain the chief concerns of local authorities, businessmen and academics in a region where Uyghur people make up almost half of the total population, especially in southern Xinjiang including Kashi. Sporadic violent attacks have been seen in regions like Kashi and Hetian and are straining people's nerves."Safety is the most important issue. We have cooperated with local governments to take measures to ensure the safety of my staff," Luo Lijian told the Global Times.Each employee in his company is asked to attend pre-service training, including lessons on how to respect the manners and customs of Uyghur people. Shuttle buses are provided to ferry workers from the construction sites to their dormitories, Luo noted.During his visit this month, Xi and other delegations from Central Asia agreed to maintain close coordination in jointly fighting the "three evil forces" of terrorism, separatism and extremism.Xinjiang authorities have taken a series of measures, including reinforcing regular patrols in communities, publicizing favorable policies for ethnic minorities and continuing to crack down on the "three evil forces.""The situation in Central Asian countries plays a vital role for the safety, stability and development in China's northwest region. The situation in Central Asia would highly influence the situation in northwest China. China should cooperate actively with members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to crack down on terrorism in Central Asia," said Xing Guangcheng, director of the Research Center for Chinese Borderland History and Geography under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Xinjiang has to reinforce its openness to the West and strengthen regional economic cooperation to obtain tremendous development and secure its borders, he noted.
