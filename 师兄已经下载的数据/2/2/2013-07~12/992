Xinjiang general axed over attack | The Japan Times
BEIJING – China’s Communist Party has expelled the military commander of Xinjiang from its ranks, state media reported Sunday, after an attack in Beijing that was officially blamed on members of the Uighur minority in the troubled northwest region.
Gen. Peng Yong, who was named commander of the Xinjiang military region in July 2011, was dismissed from his post as a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Xinjiang, the Xinjiang Daily said in a terse dispatch. The state-run paper did not give a reason for Peng’s removal but it comes after last Monday’s attack in Tiananmen Square, which was a major embarrassment for the enormous state security apparatus.
