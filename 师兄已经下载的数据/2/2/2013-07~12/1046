WASHINGTON, DC. October 12, 2013: A popular American TV show host, Cenk Uygur, blasted the Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and his government over the rigged presidential elections held on October 9. Commenting on 85% votes in favor of the incumbent president Ilham Aliyev announced by Azerbaijan's Central Election Commission, Cenk Uygur said the number itself suggests that the elections were rigged and Jesus Christ himself could not get 85% with God actively campaigning for him. Cenk Uygur criticized the US Administration for befreinding Ilham Aliyev and his authoritarian government (Azeri Report).
