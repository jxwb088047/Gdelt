A court in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has sentenced three people to death and one to 25 years in jail for a violent terrorist attack in the region’s Shanshan County.
The attack took place around 6 a.m. on the morning of June 26th in the town of Lukqun, about 250 kilometers southeast of Urumqi. 24 people were killed, including nine policemen and security guards, following an initial attack on a local police station by a terrorist group.
A police investigation later confirmed that the attacks were highly organized. The two leaders of the 17-member group had organized illegal gatherings and watched Jihadist videos made by terrorist groups abroad. Police said the terrorist group was influenced and incited by terrorist, separatist and extremist forces.
