Int'l community backs China in fight against terrorist forces - People's Daily Online
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The international community has continued to strongly condemn recent violent terrorist attacks in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The international community also has continued to extend support for Beijing to adopt resolute measures to safeguard the region's stability and crack down on terrorist activities.Turkish political analyst Abdullah Bozkurt said that Turkey is firmly opposed to the recent violent terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.Having signed a cooperative agreement with China to fight terrorism in all forms, Turkey is convinced that Beijing is highly capable of coping with Xinjiang's terrorist attacks and safeguarding the region's stability, security and peace, Bozkurt said.Gokhan Bacik, director of the Middle East Research Center at Zirve University and an analyst on Turkey-China relations, said terrorists are the common enemy of the international community.Turkey adheres to the one-China policy and respects China's efforts to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty, Bacik said.Yuri Tavrovsky, a professor at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (PFUR), said that the measures the Chinese government has taken are a powerful counterblow against certain forces that have been attempting to stir unrest in China's west.Governments of any country are entitled to take action to maintain peace and stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity, Tavrovsky said.The joint efforts made by China and other Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members, including Russia, to combat the "three evil forces" of terrorism, separatism and extremism are of great significance to Xinjiang's stability, the professor said.Martin Nguru, a lecturer at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies of University of Nairobi, said that China is a victim of terrorism.He said the Chinese government has demonstrated resolute determination to fight terrorism in its prompt response to terrorist attacks.China has made important contributions to anti-terrorism struggles, he said.Mohamed El Saket, former chief of the Arab League's representative office in China, said that no country will tolerate the act of violence and terrorism.
