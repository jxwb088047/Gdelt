Chinese police look at Xinjiang links to blast in Tiananmen Square | The Times

Police in the Chinese capital are investigating the possibility that 
protesters from the volatile western province of Xinjiang were behind a 
deadly car crash and explosion in Tiananmen Square yesterday. 


Two of the occupants of the car — one 25 and the other 43 — are believed to 
have come from an area where anti-Beijing resentment is especially raw. One 
comes from a town where 16 Uighur Muslims were shot dead in a gunfight with 
police this year. 


In a development that suggested police are now investigating a wider and 
well-planned plot to attack the emblematic Tiananmen Gate, officials issued 
an alert
