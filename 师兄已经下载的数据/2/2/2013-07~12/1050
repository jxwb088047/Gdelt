China police arrest five in connection with Tiananmen crash | Zee News
Beijing: Five people were arrested by the China police in connection with the deadly Tiananmen car crash that killed two and injured 38, reports said Thursday.
The police said that they had detained the suspects within 10 hours of the deadly blaze.
According to a statement released by the police, the three people in the car that rammed into the crowd at the Forbidden City gate near the Tiananmen Square, were one family.
The SUV that crashed was being driven by a man who was with his mother and wife, the police said.
The deadly car crash was termed as a “violent terror attack” by the police and was a "carefully planned and organised" attack.
"The initial understanding of the police is that the October 28 incident is a case of a violent terrorist attack that was carefully planned, organized and plotted," the statement said.
The car caught fire as the three ignited petrol within the vehicle, said the police.
The police identified the attackers as members of Uighur Minority Muslims from Xinjiang region as the three had Uighur names and the number plates of the SUVs that crashed had regional characters suggesting that the vehicles belonged to Xinjiang.
All three attackers died when their vehicle exploded beneath the portrait of Mao Zedong hanging from Tiananmen Gate. Two tourists, including a Filipino woman, were killed by the vehicle as it sped down a crowded sidewalk.
From the crashed SUV, the police recovered a petrol container, two knives and a flag with extremist religious slogans on it.
Uighurs are Muslim Turks native to the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang where extremists have been battling security forces for years.
