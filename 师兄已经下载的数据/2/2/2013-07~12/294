Jobs, education highlighted in Xinjiang development - People's Daily Online
BEIJING, Sept. 24 -- Top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng has called for support for employment, education and talent to ensure development and stability in northwest China's Xinjiang.Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks at a conference held on Monday and Tuesday on other regions' assistance in the development of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region."Xinjiang still faces many special difficulties in development and stability. It needs the support of the entire country," Yu said.Urging a boost to employment in the region, Yu called for policy and employment services to provide more career opportunities for local people -- especially those from minority groups in south Xinjiang -- while encouraging them to seek jobs in other regions.Yu stressed bilingual and vocational education as well as education on ideology and politics to promote scientific knowledge and competence among local people.Yu also called for more talent support by simultaneously inviting inland elites to work in Xinjiang and fostering local talent with professional quality and managerial capabilities.According to Yu, other regions of the country should support Xinjiang, by setting goals and ensuring implementation of projects in the region.The government has a series of projects and policies to support economic and social development in Xinjiang, including a "pairing assistance" program.The program, in place since 2010, requires 19 provinces and municipalities to support Xinjiang in building new infrastructure and promoting local industry.
