Clash in Chinaâ€™s Xinjiang region leaves 16 dead - Australia Network News - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)
Sixteen people have reportedly been killed in a clash in China's far western region of Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority.
State media reports say police were attempting to detain criminal suspects in Shufu village near Kashgar, the country's westernmost city, when they were attacked by "thugs" armed with explosive devices and knives on Sunday.
Two police officers were killed and 14 of the attackers were shot dead.
A brief government statement says an investigation has been launched and two suspects have been detained.
In recent weeks Chinese authorities have launched a crackdown in the Muslim far west of the country after three ethnic Uyghurs - allegedly seeking Xinjiang independence - self-immolated inside a car in front of Beijing's Tiananmen Gate.
Two others were killed in the incident and another 40 were injured.
Xinjiang, a vast area bordering Pakistan and Central Asia, has followed Islam for centuries.
For years it has seen sporadic unrest by Uyghurs, which rights groups say is driven by cultural oppression and intrusive security measures.
However China attributes the conflict to extremist religion, terrorism and separatism.
