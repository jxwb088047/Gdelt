Three Sentenced To Death In China Over Xinjiang Riots
A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced three men to death and another to 25 years in jail for violence, which the court termed a terrorist attack, in Xinjiang that left 24 people dead in the province's Shanshan county on June 26 last, state media reported.
All the four were found guilty of organizing, leading and participating in a terrorist organization, homicide and arson. They were also accused of advocating and spreading religious extremism, watching violence-inciting videos from foreign terror outfits, and reading books on religious extremism to conspire terrorist activities, the Xinhua news agency said.
A 13-member gang led by the four convicts carried out the violent attack early on the morning of June 26. Police investigation showed that the multiple attacks in Shanshan were a premeditated and organized violent terrorist crime.
The attacks killed 24 people, including two police officers, and injured 23 others and resulted in an economic loss of 2.13 million yuan, the report said.
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been witnessing sporadic clashes between Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities often inviting intervention by security forces. Uighurs, a Turkic speaking community, constitute about 45 percent of Xinjiang's population. They say the influx of Han Chinese residents into their region has marginalized their traditional culture.
Beijing authorities often blame violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uighur extremists seeking autonomy for the region. But Uighur activists accuse Beijing of over-exaggerating the threat to justify heavy-handed rule in the remote province in China's northwest.
