Minister calls for better border defense in Xinjiang
URUMQI, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chang Wanquan has called for a strengthened border and national defense in northwest China's Xinjiang at the end of a week-long inspection tour in the region on Tuesday.
Chang asked military units to further consolidate border defense and cast 'a wall of copper and steel' in the frontier.
He told military units to lay a solid basis for Xinjiang's long-term peace and stability by consolidating political power in grassroots governments and stepping up the fight against encroachment, separatist and terrorist activities.
The official said Xinjiang's stability was of great significance to safeguarding national unity, state security and the country's social stability.
Military units were told to put border and national defense into prominent place and contribute to the consolidation of the defense in China's borders.
They are also required to operate under the instructions of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Central Military Commission(CMC) and CMC Chairman Xi Jinping.
The minister demanded military officers to strengthen strategic thinking, carry forward construction projects as well as take initiatives (in operations).
