Minitrue: Liquid Ammonia Explosion in Xinjiang - China Digital Times (CDT)
The following censorship instructions, issued to the media by government authorities, have been leaked and distributed online. Chinese journalists and bloggers often refer to these instructions as Directives from the Ministry of Truth.
State Council Information Office: Do not republish [coverage] of, comment on, or independently investigate reports of an explosion at a Xinjiang Bagang Steel Structure Co. Ltd. workshop; all websites must delete previous posts. (November 11, 2013)
A liquid ammonia explosion at the Urumqi plant late last night has killed six people and injured another six, according to Xinhua [zh]. In September, an ammonia leak at a Shanghai refrigeration plant killed 15 and sickened 26.
CDT has collected the selections we translate here from a variety of sources and has checked them against official Chinese media reports to confirm their implementation.
Since directives are sometimes communicated orally to journalists and editors, who then leak them online, the wording published here may not be exact. The original publication date on CDT Chinese is noted after the directives; the date given may indicate when the directive was leaked, rather than when it was issued. CDT does its utmost to verify dates and wording, but also takes precautions to protect the source.
