In pictures: China steps up security in Xinjiang - BBC News
China steps up security operations in Xinjiang following a number of violent incidents.
China has stepped up security in the western region of Xinjiang, following a number of violent incidents in recent months.
On Saturday patrols, with tanks and armed personnel, were prominent on the streets of Urumqi, the Xinjiang regional capital which saw deadly ethnic clashes in 2009.
The move follows reports of an attack on a police station in Hotan on Friday and clashes in Turpan on Wednesday that left 35 people dead.
State media gave few details of either incident, but Xinjiang has seen sporadic outbreaks of violence fuelled by ethnic tensions in recent years.
The Muslim Uighur community makes up about 45% of the population in the region, which borders central Asia.
But many Uighurs feel that an influx of Han Chinese has left their culture marginalised and say they receive heavy-handed treatment from the authorities. China, meanwhile, says it has poured investment into the region to improve people's lives.
