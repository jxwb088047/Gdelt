Goldwind nets Cuban wind turbine deal |Companies |chinadaily.com.cn
Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co Ltd, a manufacturer of wind turbines, announced on Wednesday that its wholly owned subsidiary Goldwind International Holdings signed a 51-megawatt wind turbine supply contract with Energoimport, a subsidiary of Union Electrica, in Cuba.
The Urumqi-based company said the move was key move for the company to expand in the South American market. It is the second order that Goldwind has won in Cuba following an order for six units of 750-kW wind turbines in 2009.
Under the contract, the Chinese wind turbine maker will provide 34 units of Goldwind's 1.5-MW, direct-drive permanent magnet wind turbines to the Cuban company along with additional services including turbine transportation, installation, trial operations and a two-year warranty for maintenance.
Earlier reports said Goldwind, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, was ranked among the global top five in recent years in terms of new wind-energy installations. Currently, the company has presences in Germany, Australia and the United States. Goldwind has also installed wind turbines in China, the US, Canada, Cuba, Pakistan and Europe.
