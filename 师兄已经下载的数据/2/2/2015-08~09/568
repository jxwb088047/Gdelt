Problem, reaction, solution. They created this narrative to get a reaction from the public, so they can offer up their solution of background checks for guns. They know people will die to protect the second amendment, which is there to protect us against a tyrannical government, so they have to manufacture consent. That way people will accept the legislation that curtails the second amendment, and the federal government can control who gets a gun & who doesn\'t with this broad term of \'mental illness\'. 1 in 5 Americans are deemed mentally ill because they\'re depressed...The American Psychiatric Association gets a team of Psychiatrists together and subjectively vote to classify all sorts of basic human conditions as \"illnesses\" in their book DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), the opportunities to sell drugs & medicate are endless...it\'s only going to get worse =/...

Why should we blame guns for this “senseless crime” when Bryce Williams probably didn’t own a gun until June 19th, 2015? “He was a crazy man that got a gun,” Andy Parker told Fox News’ Meygan Kelly. Mr. Parker didn’t call Bryce Williams a gun-nut, just a crazy guy who was able to get a gun. Guns are not the problem. Gun Control is not the answer to stopping violence. Using this tragedy to promote more gun legislation is disgusting to me. I would gladly debate Andy Parker or Chris Hurst on this issue any time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1TqS9QIAOU If they’re willing to go on national television and voice their intentions on promoting stricter gun legislation, then they need to ‘man-up’ and engage in a healthy debate about this topic. If it comes out that Bryce Williams was on some type of medication, will Andy Parker and Chris Hurst blame the medications? I sure hope so.

Despite the fact that Andy Parker told Megyn Kelly, “I was told this [interview] would be about Alison’s life and what she meant,” he then used the opportunity to promote more gun control in the United States. In a separate interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, Andy Parker made his intentions clear, “It’s senseless that her life and Adam’s life were taken by a crazy person with a gun. If I have to be the John Walsh of gun control…look I’m for the second amendment but there has to be a way to force politicians that are cowards and in the pockets of the NRA to come to grips and have sensible laws so that crazy people can’t get guns. It can’t be that hard, and yet politicians from the local level to the stat...

It\'s been less than a week since murder set their lives onto a new 
course, into roles they never wanted to take on and into a battle 
they never planned to fight. 
But only five days in, Andy and Barbara Parker -- the parents of 
slain television journalist Alison Parker -- speak about gun control 
with a passion as if they\'d spent their lifetimes fighting for it. 
\"You can\'t change the world in a day,\" Barbara Parker told CNN. \"But 
we cannot be intimidated, we cannot be pushed aside.\"
On Wednesday, Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward -- two journalists 
for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia -- were killed on live television by a 
disgruntled former employee. 
In the days since, Andy Parker has emerged as perhaps the world\'s most 
visible advocate for gun control, making numerous appearances on numerous 
networks and even holding a news conference. 
On Sunday, both of the Parkers spoke to CNN\'s Poppy Harlow, telling her 
that ending gun violence has become each of their lives\' missions -- and 
the grieving parents pledged to be as unrelenting and as feisty as their 
daughter in achieving it.
\"Alison would be really mad at me if I didn\'t take this on,\" said Andy Parker. 
\"And I promise you, these people are messing with the wrong family. We are 
going to effect a change.\"...
