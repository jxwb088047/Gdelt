by the numbers - The Truth About Cars
Record new vehicle sales volume in 2015 was powered largely by growth in the SUV/crossover category and further strengthening byÂ pickup trucks. Flat car sales and declining minivan volume served to impede U.S. auto sales growth.
Prior to 2015, consumers, businesses, and government agencies had not combined to purchase and lease more than 17 million new vehicles since 2001. With 17.47 million sales in 2015, year-over-year volume jumped 6Â percent and total new vehicle sales soared 67 percent compared with 2009, when auto sales plunged to theirÂ lowest depths duringÂ the recession.

The U.S. auto industry generated an overall sales increase in November 2015 despite notable decreases at American Honda and Volkswagen Group, andÂ a shorter-than-normal November selling season.
So strong were the numbers produced in the lead-up to and during November that analysts and forecasters areÂ all but certain that 2015 will go down as the best year ever for auto sales volume in America. Just six years removed from the doldrums of 2009, auto sales in 2015 are expanding for a fifth consecutive year, rising 52 percent compared with 2010 and 5 percent compared with 2014.
This is the theme of auto sales coverage as we approach the end of 2015, as bestseller lists highlighting the strength of pickup trucks and ever more popular crossovers are being prepped. But what about the small figures behind the big numbers; the less well-known stories which contribute to the overall theme?
âVery little to dislike,â I found myself responding day after day during my week with the 2016 Honda Accord.
Rarely does a visiting test car generate asÂ many questions and compliments. But the slightly restyled Accord, riding on the Touringâs eye catching, wheel-arch-filling 19-inch wheels, was deemed by friends, family, and neighbours to be quite the looker. And because itâs a car thatâs squarely positioned in the affordable realm, they didnât just compliment the Accord the way they did the $85,000 Audi A6 I drove earlier this fall. Rather, theyâd ask, âWould I like it?â (Read More…)
After coveringÂ the northernmost city in China (Mohe),Â we now travel to ÃrÃ¼mqiÂ in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region inÂ the westernmost part of China. I thought we may as well push it to the extreme and explore the provincial capital furthest from Beijing, a whopping 1,500 miles (2,400 km) away.
In fact, ÃrÃ¼mqiÂ â pronounced something resembling “Yooloomooshee” â is both geographically and culturally closer to Kabul in Afghanistan than it is to Beijing. The majority of the population is Muslim and most Chinese road signs are dubbed in Arabic and sometimes Cyrillic script.
What are the most popular vehicles in this remote part of the world?
Bugatti reportedly sold the last Veyron, a car which will be displayed at the Geneva auto show in March, to a customer in the Middle East.
Volkswagen-owned Bugattiâs 450-unit production run comes to a close after nearly a decade of delivering cars to customers. Although the cars routinely sold for more than $2M, Bloomberg referenced Singapore-based analyst Max Warburton who believes VW lost â¬4.6M per car, more than USD $5M.
Unlike the detailed sales reports we see each month from Volkswagen of Americaâs namesake brand, Veyron-specific numbers were neverÂ formally reported. Automotive News reports that approximately one-quarter, or 113, of the Bugatti Veyrons produced ended up in the United States. (Read More…)
Cars are like fruits and vegetables: They sell better fresh. Of course, even the freshest dud remains a dud. But all else being equal, those with a fresher line-up outsell those with aged product. TrueCar has put together an interesting table: What are the proportions of model year 2011 (yes, they are still on the lots), 2012, and 2013 in a brandâs sales? (Read More…)
Now here is an interesting tidbit from Volkswagenâs press conference of today. Â Remember when three weeks ago J.D. Power announced that 72 million light-vehicles were sold worldwide in 2010, a number never seen before? Volkswagen has a different picture. (Read More…)
