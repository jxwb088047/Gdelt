ANOTHER Black Woman Dies In Police Custody
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiAugust 12, 2015Leave a Comment
Another week and another unnecessary and extremely tragic death of an African American woman in police custody. The incident occurred in late July in Cleveland, when Ralkina Jones was denied her medicine by authorities. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A black Cleveland woman who died in police custody pleaded with jail officials to properly administer her prescription medications in the hours before her death.
“I don’t want to die in your cell,” she told officers in video released Tuesday.”*
