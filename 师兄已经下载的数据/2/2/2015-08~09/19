President Obama, coming out of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping where the country\'s suspected hacking was expected to factor heavily, announced Friday the two nations have reached a preliminary agreement on cyber-theft -- and said he indicated to Xi that the cyber-threat \"has to stop.\" 
Speaking in the Rose Garden alongside the Chinese leader, Obama said he raised with his Chinese counterpart the United States\' \"very serious concerns about growing cyber threats to American corporations and American citizens.\" 
He added, \"I indicated that it has to stop.\" 
Obama said the two leaders have, to that end, agreed that neither government \"will conduct or knowingly support the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage.\" 
As for the possibility of sanctions, against either individuals, businesses or state-run companies, he said: \"We will apply those, and whatever other tools we have in our tool kit, to go after cybercriminals either retrospectively or prospectively.\"
The cyber issue and others have hung over the state visit. Against the backdrop of grand pageantry, Obama earlier prodded Xi on Friday to \"candidly\" address deep differences on cyberespionage, China\'s territorial disputes, and human rights -- issues that have threatened ties between the world\'s two largest economies.

China signed a long-awaited, 30-year deal on Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth 400 (b) billion US dollars.
Negotiations on the price for the gas had continued into the final hours of a two-day visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to China.
Putin, shunned by the West over Ukraine, wants to expand Russia\'s dealings with Asia and diversify markets for its gas, which now goes mostly to Europe.
\"The development of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Russia is necessary for improving international justice and ensuring global peace and development,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told media in Beijing. 
Meanwhile, China also said a senior foreign ministry official had met with United States representatives in Beijing to continue China\'s opposition to the indictment of five Chinese military officers charged by the US with cyberspying.
Monday\'s indictment said People\'s Liberation Army officers targeted US makers of nuclear and solar technology, stealing confidential business information, sensitive trade secrets and internal communications.
\"The Chinese government, military and other relevant bodies have never been involved in any so-called cyberspying activities,\" said Hong on Wednesday. 
\"The charges are totally groundless and done with ulterior motives.\"

WASHINGTON D.C. — While China and Xi Jinping were busy blowing their own horns, the Chinese \'stock market\' nearly imploded, so the all-mighty party stepped in and spent billions to bolster the market and failed miserably. While the rest of the world has started to see the cracks, the U.S. has chosen to dive right in. 
 
\'President\' Xi, who\'s now in the U.S. for the next week, said at a speech in Seattle that the Chinese will not in any form engage in commercial theft or hacking, which is pretty ironic considering the Chinese have used nothing but cybertheft and straight up plagiarism as their secret to success. 

Xi and his group of Chinese CEOs met with U.S. business and tech leaders eager to bend over and offer backdoors just for a little piece of the mooncake. It\'s refreshing to see U.S. companies like Microsoft, Apple, Boeing and Starbucks sell out just to make a buck.

What about issues like China building fake islands in the South China Sea or its awesome human rights record? For those hoping for Obama to get hard on Xi when he visits the White House, looks like Obama is only willing to get a hard on for Xi. 

The U.S. says it wants to send a strong signal to China. Guess that signal is: \"we\'ll do anything for some business.\" But hey, at least the U.S. will get a new, Made in China high speed train from L.A. to Vegas.

China and US agree on stopping cyber theft of business secrets...
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accusing China of vast business spying, the United States charged five military officials on Monday with hacking into U.S. companies to steal vital trade secrets in a case intensifying already-rising tensions between the international economic giants.
 
The Chinese targeted big-name American makers of nuclear and solar technology, stealing confidential business information, sensitive trade secrets and internal communications for competitive advantage, according to a grand jury indictment that the Justice Department said should be a national \"wake-up call\" about cyber intrusions.
 
A company\'s success in the international marketplace should not be based \"on a sponsor government\'s ability to spy and steal business secrets,\" Attorney General Eric Holder declared at a news conference.
 
The alleged targets were Alcoa World Alumina, Westinghouse Electric Co., Allegheny Technologies, U.S. Steel Corp., the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld. The indictment, which includes charges of trade-secret theft and economic espionage, was issued in Pittsburgh, where most of the companies are based.
 
China denied it all. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said the charges were based on \"fabricated facts\" and would jeopardize China-U.S. \"cooperation and mutual trust.\"
 
\"China is steadfast in upholding cybersecurity,\" said the statement. \"The Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cybertheft of trade secrets. The U.S. accusation against Chinese personnel is purely ungrounded and absurd.\"...

US President Barack Obama has said that the US and China have agreed not to conduct cyber theft on each other\'s private sector for profit.

Obama hosted his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on his first state visit to Washington. This amid tensions over alleged Chinese cyber espionage, and territorial disputes with its neighbors. President Xi acknowledged that the US and China are two major cyber countries, and ruled out confrontation and friction as the right choice for both sides. Obama also expressed concerns over China\'s activities in the South China Sea, calling for international disputes to be resolved peacefully. Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over spying and China\'s claims in the South China Sea. But the relationship underpins the entire global economy.

U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus says his country will continue to fight cybertheft, strengthen economic ties with China, and help Beijing tackle environmental problems in his first public speech since taking office in March.

Full Story:
Cyber-theft of trade secrets by China is a threat to U.S. national security, U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus said on Wednesday in the first major public address of his tenure, warning that Washington would continue to pressure Beijing.

Baucus\' remarks come as commercial ties between the world\'s two largest economies have been strained over cyber espionage charges and revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying.

In May, Washington indicted five Chinese military officers for hacking U.S. companies, prompting Beijing to suspend a Sino-U.S. working group on cyber issues. It adamantly denies the charges.

Such behaviour is criminal and runs counter to China\'s World Trade Organization commitments, Baucus told business leaders at an American Chamber of Commerce in China luncheon two weeks ahead of annual high-level bilateral talks in Beijing.

\"We also have strong disagreements over permissible behaviour in the cyber realm. Cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets by state actors in China has emerged as a major threat to our economic, and thus, national security. Besides being criminal in nature, this behaviour runs counter to China\'s WTO commitments. We won\'t sit idly by when a crime is committed in the real world. So why should we when it happens in cyber space? We will continue to use diplomatic...

Time now for a look through the international headlines we\'re following this hour. We turn to our Eunice Kim at the NewsCenter for that. 
Eunice... China has denounced and denied U.S. charges that five of its army officers hacked into the computers of American companies...

Right. It\'s another thorn in the already thorny Sino-U.S. relations,... and it represents a shift in the way the United States goes after hackers.
Here\'s Yoo Li-an with the story. 
China says charges that five of its military officers have been engaging in cyber espionage are completely \"made up.\"
China\'s foreign ministry on Monday called on the U.S. to immediately withdraw its charges, saying they will only stand to damage U.S.-China relations. 
In the most immediate sign that they will, Beijing has already said they are suspending the activities of the China-U.S. Cyber Working Group,... an intiative agreed on by both countries just one month ago.
Earlier on Monday,.. U.S. prosecutors charged five Chinese military officers of stealing trade secrets from five companies.
It\'s the first time the U.S. has filed such criminal charges against a foreign state.

\"What I think distinguishes this case is that we have a state-sponsored entity, state-sponsored individuals using intelligence tools to gain commercial advantage. That is what makes this case different.\"

The accused officers belong to Unit 61398 of the People\'s Liberation Army,... a unit long believed to be staffed by thousands of Chinese \"cyber-troops.\"
China denies any involvement, which doesn\'t come as a surprise to experts.

China said on Thursday it continued to believe that \"terrorism is a common enemy of the entire world\" after US President Barack Obama laid out a new foreign policy strategy on Wednesday.
Foreign ministry spokesperson Qin Gang told media in Beijing that \"(terrorism) deserves to be cracked down on with the strengthened cooperation of the international community.\"
The comments come after a Chinese court announced guilty verdicts for 55 people on charges of terrorism, separatism and murder in a stadium filled with 7-thousand people on Thursday.
The public event was a show of force in Xinjiang after 43 people were killed last week in an attack at a vegetable market in the regional capital, Urumqi.
It comes as the government tries to display its determination to combat unrest in the troubled northwest region.
Meanwhile, Qin also accused the US of deliberately fabricating information in the indictment of five Chinese military officers charged by the US with cyberspying.
\"China is firmly opposed to hackers and the act of stealing secrets electronically. We not only say this, but also forbid it by law,\" he said.
Last week\'s indictments said People\'s Liberation Army officers targeted US makers of nuclear and solar technology, stealing confidential business information, sensitive trade secrets and internal communications.

US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have said they will take new steps to address cybercrime.

Speaking at a joint news conference at the White House, Mr Obama said they had agreed that neither country would engage in cyber economic espionage.

The deal covers the theft of trade secrets but not national security information.

President Xi also pledged to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr Obama said any escalation in China\'s alleged cybercrimes against the US would prompt sanctions.

\"It has to stop,\" he said. \"The question is now, are words followed by action?\"

Reflecting on the use of sanctions against either individuals, businesses or state-run companies, he said: \"We will apply those, and whatever other tools we have in our tool kit, to go after cybercriminals either retrospectively or prospectively.\"

Both countries deny taking part in the cybertheft of commercial secrets.

The Chinese president said the two countries would not \"knowingly support\" such practices and said they would both abide by \"norms of behaviour\" in cyberspace.

\"Confrontation and friction are not the right choice for both sides,\" said Mr Xi, speaking through a translator.

The cybertheft of intellectual property designed to benefit Chinese industry was described by former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander as \"the greatest transfer of wealth in history\".

US officials have alleged that the Chinese state was behind a massive data security breach of government databases as well as attacks on private firms. That kind of breach ...
