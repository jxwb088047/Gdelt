Cop Gets Pistol-Whipped
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiAugust 18, 2015Leave a Comment
There was an altercation in Alabama involving a police detective and an unarmed suspect who quickly turned into an armed suspect. After being pulled over in traffic, Janard Cunningham reportedly sucker-punched the anonymous officer, took his gun and used it to pistol-whip him unconscious. The suspect fled, but was later apprehended by authorities. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The story of an Alabama police detective went viral this week after being pistol-whipped with his own gun for fear of becoming the newest police headline.
“A lot of officers are being too cautious because of what’s going on in the media,” the officer later told reporters. “I hesitated because I didn’t want to be in the media like I am right now.”
The officer, who has asked to remain anonymous, was attacked last Friday after stopping a car that was erratically moving down the highway. After pulling-over to a parking lot at a shopping mall, Janard Cunningham reportedly got out of the car, sucker-punched the officer, and then grabbed the officers gun which he used to pistol-whip him unconscious.”*
