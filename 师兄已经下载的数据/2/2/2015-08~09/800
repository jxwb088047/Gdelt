Michelle Fields has just been fired from Fox News\' Cashin\' In in the latest fallout over #GragGate and her allegations Trump campaign manger Corey Lewandwoski assaulted her and, \"aggressively tried to pull me to the ground,\" and insinuating that he \"[attempted] to forcefully throw\" her down when all evidence shows he tried to non-verbally signal to her that the press conference was over and that Trump was leaving. 

According to the Daily Beast, \"multiple sources close to the situation, [say] she received a phone call from Bolling’s producer informing her that she will no longer appear on Cashin’ In.\" She also deleted the Cashin\' In header on her Twitter account and removed any mention of her weekly appearance on the show from the Description on her account.

Case Closed!
FOX News aired a follow-up segment on the Michelle Fields media hoax leveled against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. In the segment FOX played video posted previously at The Gateway Pundit that shows Corey Lewandowski walking past anti-Trump reporter Michelle Fields. In the video Fields does not flinch. Her facial expression does not change. This proves that what Michelle Fields has been telling the media was fabricated. Thank you FOX News for showing the truth....

Fox News Channel (FNC), also referred to as Fox News, is a cable and satellite television news channel owned by the Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of News Corporation. As of April 2009, the channel is available to 102 million households in the United States and further to viewers internationally, broadcasting primarily from its New York studios.
The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who hired former NBC executive Roger Ailes as the founding CEO. The channel was launched on October 7, 1996 to 17 million cable subscribers. The channel grew in the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant cable news network in the United States. In 2010, the network's programs took the top 10 spots for most-watched cable news programs in the 25–54 demographic and the top 12 spots among total cable news programs viewers.
Critics have asserted that Fox News Channel promotes conservative political positions, and biased reporting. Commentators, news anchors, and reporters at Fox News Channel have responded that news reporting and political commentary operate independently of each other, and deny any bias in the news reporting.
