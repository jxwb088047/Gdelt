China Exclusive: Xinjiang pledges "deeper battle" against terrorism - Xinhua | English.news.cn
URUMQI, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will wage deeper battles against terror-related violence, a top regional official said.
"Xinjiang has been a main battlefield of anti-terrorism. Terror-related violence has been targeted with harsh punishment according to the law. It has showed the perpetrators their eventual outcomes," said Akber Eklam, deputy head of the higher people's court of Xinjiang, in a interview with Xinhua.
"With the concerted efforts of people, and the construction of our legal system, a people's war against terrorism will be deepened in Xinjiang, and eventually, the people will win," he said.
Citing an amendment to the Criminal Law, which was passed last month, Eklam said the added terms, which target terrorism and extremism, cover "the whole chain of terror-related crimes".
"The different steps of organizing, leading, planning, executing, funding, instigating and communication in terror cases are all covered by the amendment. It shows a resolute action to exterminate the evils of terrorism," he said.
Xinjiang has seen rising terror-related cases. By April, a total of 181 terror groups have been dismantled during a year-long campaign, which was launched a day after a market bombing in the regional capital of Urumqi that killed 39 people on May 22, 2014.
More than 96 percent of terror groups were thwarted at the planning stage, and 112 suspects turned themselves in to the police, according to statistics.
Members of the public have been encouraged to battle terrorism. In August last year, thousands of volunteers helped local police chase suspects in Karakax??? County in the south.
"If the terrorists dared to show up again, my family will catch these evil man and bring them to law enforcement," said Mamat Turson, a farmer
Senior Chinese officials on Wednesday vowed to continue assistance to Xinjiang to maintain stability and prosperity in the northwestern region.
On Wednesday, Yu Zhengsheng, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said more work will be needed to build "the ability to battle terrorism and maintain stability."
Xinjiang will receive aid in anti-terrorism efforts at the grassroots level, he said.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was founded on Oct. 1, 1955, after the local legislature elected the first regional government leadership.
