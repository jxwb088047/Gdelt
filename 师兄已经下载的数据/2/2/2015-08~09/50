A group of 55 Chinese and foreign journalists have wrapped up a ten-day tour to observe the development and changes that have taken place in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
The tour covered some 20 prefectures and counties including Urumqi, Turpan, Aksu and Kashgar. Many cities have been designated by the central government to assist Xinjiang's development in recent years.
Â And in the past year, provinces and cities including Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong and Shanghai arranged almost 1.3 billion yuan of funds to help boost the region's economic growth. " What we saw and heard during the tour is that the local Han ethnic group is living harmoniously with the ethnic minorities such as the Uygurs and Kazaks in Xinjiang. Other countries should learn from the Chinese government in terms of their policies regarding ethnic minorities," said Mahdi Zalzadeh, program director of Iran.
