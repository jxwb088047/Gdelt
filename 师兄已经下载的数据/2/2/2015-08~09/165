Xinjiang commodity expo draws 20,000 businesses - Xinhua | English.news.cn
URUMQI, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- The 2015 Eurasia Commodity and Trade Expo opened Wednesday in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, drawing more than 20,000 businesses from 40 countries and regions.
The expo is held alternating years with the China-Eurasia Expo, focusing on commodity exhibitions and trade, with fewer meetings and forums.
Yu Huan, an official with the regional government who leads the expo organizing committee, said the expo is an important economic activity as Xinjiang celebrates the 60th anniversary of its establishment as an autonomous region this year.
"We plan to use the expo to attract investors and companies to Xinjiang, which, like other regions, is under big economic pressure," he said.
"After the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed, Xinjiang has received a large amount of attention. It has become another hotspot for investment and business opportunities," he said.
Steven Phillips, chief executive of China-Britain Business Council, who brought 23 British companies selling purses, cosmetics and clothes to the expo, said he was looking to attract the purchasing power of the Chinese hinterland buyers.
A total of 824 overseas companies are exhibiting at the expo, which lasts until Aug. 16.
