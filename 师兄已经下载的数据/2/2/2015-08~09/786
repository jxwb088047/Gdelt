Karamay oilfield generated over 300 mln tons of oil in 6 decades - People's Daily Online

 Being the first oil field found in China, Karamay oilfield has generated 300 million tons of crude oil since its discovery 6 decades ago.

 Located in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Karamay also contributed over 70 billion cubic meters of natural gas to national energy supply in the past 60 years.

 Its accumulated proven geological crude oil reserves amount to 2.6 billion tons.

 Though having been developed for over half a century, Kararmay still has bright prospects. In 2014, Karamay oilfield had an annual cumulative production of 11.8 million tons crude oil and 2.71 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

 Karamay Oilfield has stably generated crude oil more than 10 million tons annually for 13 consecutive years.

 With the first industrial oil gushed from Karamay Well 1# on October 29, 1955, Karamay became the first large oilfield in the new China. China has since got rid of its name of an oil-poor country.

 After more than half a century's efforts by generations of oil workers, a series of significant results have yielded in the exploration and development of Junggar Basin.

 The important discovery in exploration is the key factor to drive the development of oil industry to the upper level. It is critical both to increase the pace of oil production and to maintain a virtuous circle in the exploration and development, and it is of the biggest economic interest.

 As China's most important petroleum and petrochemical production base, Karamay oilfield, in recent years, adhere to promote technological progress and management innovation.

 After 60 years of ecological reconstruction, today’s Karamay has become a livable city for a population of 4,50,000, with 11.5 square meters of green area per capita and a urban green coverage rate of 43%.
