Following the deadly attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015, 31 US state officials declared that they would deny entry to Syrian refugees, citing security concerns. The refugee resettlement program has already been under scrutiny in the US for a few months, and by December 11, Congress will make a decision on the 206 federal budget, which includes deciding on the contentious issue of whether the refugee resettlement program will get the funding it needs to operate.

VICE News spends a day with a Syrian refugee family in New Jersey, to learn about their journey to America, life as refugees, and their outlook on the future.

As Syria’s civil war has raged over the past four years, more than a million refugees have fled into neighboring Lebanon. The Bekaa Valley, which serves as the main passageway between Damascus and Beirut, is now home to the largest concentration of Lebanon’s Syrian refugees.

Currently in Lebanon there is one Syrian for every four Lebanese citizens — a population growth that has created a strain on the small villages and towns that bear the responsibility of hosting the refugees. Al Marj, a small city of about 15,000 in the southern end of the Bekaa Valley, is home to a refugee camp where approximately 400 families are living.

VICE News traveled to the Bekaa Valley to see how the refugee population is faring as winter fully sets in, and found that the freezing temperatures are only one of their problems.

Over the past year, images of dramatic sea crossings to Europe focused international attention on Syria\'s refugee crisis. But the vast majority of those fleeing Syria\'s civil war, including the most vulnerable, remain in the Middle East, living marginal existences with uncertain futures. More than one million of those Syrians are currently living in limbo in Lebanon, which now hosts more refugees per capita than any other country in the world.

When VICE News first met families in the Al Marj refugee camp over a year ago, many expressed their hope to return to Syria. A year later, we found them learning hard lessons in how they might survive in an exile that could last for many more years.

VICE News returns to a refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese city of Al Marj, where refugees are struggling to meet their own basic needs.

If you bomb the Middle East and create refugees, expect some of those refugees to be under cover militants. ISIS admitted they were going to do this. And for governments and the corporate-state media to ignore that is just downright dangerous and treasonous. It\'s subversive propaganda that is targeting innocent people and all major corporate-state media and banker-puppet politicians are in on it. When ISIS attacks, the blood will be on their hands.

The number of Syrian refugees that are trying to make it to the EU is rising fast. What is more surprising though is where they are not trying to go. They are not headed to the Gulf States because those countries are refusing to let any of them in. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

Should the Gulf States start allowing refugees? Should America do more? Let us know in the comments below.

\"As the crisis brews over Syrian refugees trying to enter European countries, questions have been raised over why they are not heading to wealthy Gulf states closer to home.

Officially, Syrians can apply for a tourist visa or work permit in order to enter a Gulf state.

But the process is costly, and there is a widespread perception that many Gulf states have unwritten restrictions in place that make it hard for Syrians to be granted a visa in practice.”*

A photographer, reportedly working for Hungarian news station N1TV, was caught on camera tripping a Syrian refugee who was trying to escape from the police in the village of Röszke. The refugee was carrying a child at the time.”*

\"They say reporters shouldn’t try to make themselves part of the story, but perhaps someone should have told the camera crews.

A photographer, reportedly working for Hungarian news station N1TV, was caught on camera tripping a Syrian refugee who was trying to escape from the police in the village of Röszke. The refugee was carrying a child at the time.”*

Here in the United States our reactions to terrorism are oftentimes unfortunate. Several states are closing themselves to Syrian refugees out of fear of ISIS. The sad thing is that ISIS is the very group the refugees are fleeing. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"As of Monday afternoon, 23 governors had issued statements saying they would barSyrian refugees from settling in their states, citing fears that violent extremists will masquerade as refugees in order to gain entry to the United States.

Legally, these proclamations have little effect; states don\'t have the authority to bar refugees from settling within their borders. But that hasn\'t stopped governors from issuing statements. The growing list of states that will not accept Syrian refugees currently includes Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Twenty-two of those states are led by Republican governors. Just one, New Hampshire, has a Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan.”*

In which John Green meets Hussam, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee living in the Azraq refugee camp in Northern Jordan with his mother and little brother. Hussam learned English in the camp in three months with help from YouTube videos and a tutor. His family is spread across four countries, and he dreams of reuniting with them and becoming an engineer so he can help rebuild Syria.
