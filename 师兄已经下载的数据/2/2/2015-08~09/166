(Visit: http://www.uctv.tv/) Using specially commissioned interactive maps to display alternative solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, David Makovsky and Ghaith al-Omari argue that a two-state solution based on land-swaps is the only viable one for the future. The core principle of these swaps is to reconcile the Palestinian demand for a return to the pre-1967 lines with Israel\'s desire to include as many of the West Bank\'s 300,000 settlers in Israel proper as possible. They argue that any feasible scenario must include Israel\'s granting Palestinians arable land from within Israel\'s pre-1967 border in exchange for annexed settlement blocs (clusters of settlements) and that it is essential that, for any land annexed by Israel as part of a deal, Palestinians receive equal amounts of land. David Makovsky is the Director of the Project on the Middle East Peace Process at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Ghaith al-Omari is the Executive Director of the American Task Force on Palestine. Series: \"Herman P. and Sophia Taubman Endowed Symposia in Jewish Studies\" [Public Affairs] [Show ID: 24895]...

\"Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed a hardliner who previously opposed a Palestinian state to be Israel\'s chief negotiator in any peace talks.

The prime minister chose Silvan Shalom, who is also the new interior minister, to be Israel\'s point of contact with the Palestinians.

In addition, Mr Shalom will represent Israel in talks with the US concerning Iran\'s nuclear programme.

But unlike the outgoing chief negotiator, Tzipi Livni, Mr Shalom has never endorsed the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\"

Israel and Palestinians have struggled to come to a two-state solution, but the fault lies with Hamas and the Palestinians, according to former CIA director James Woolsey. Woolsey explains how human civilian shields have been used by Hamas to inflate their own casualties at the expense of good will towards Israel, and how Clinton\'s parameters for a solution to the conflict was rejected by Arafat.

Palestine (Arabic: فلسطين‎ Filasṭīn, Falasṭīn, Filisṭīn; Greek: Παλαιστίνη, Palaistinē; Latin: Palaestina; Hebrew: פלשתינה Palestina) is a conventional name, among others, used to describe the geographic region between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, and various adjoining lands. The region is also known as the Land of Israel (Hebrew: ארץ־ישראל Eretz-Yisra'el), the Holy Land and the Southern Levant, and historically has been known by other names including Canaan, Zion, Syria Palaestina, Southern Syria, Jund Filastin and Outremer.
The boundaries of the region have changed throughout history, and were first defined in modern times by the Franco-British boundary agreement (1920) and the Transjordan memorandum of 16 September 1922, during the mandate period. Today, the region comprises the country of Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Palestine is also used to refer to the State of Palestine which, since the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988, has referred to a state in the Palestinian territories on 22% of "historical Palestine". The State of Palestine is recognized today by approximately two-thirds of the world's countries, although this status is not recognized by the United Nations, Israel and major Western nations such as the United States.
