BANGKOK, 24 September 2015: Malaysian police have arrested eight suspects they believed helped to smuggle Bangkok bomb suspects out of Thailand, a PBS TV news report confirmed Thursday.
The Erawan Shrine bomb attack in Bangkok killed 20 people and injured 120, 17 August. Fourteen of the dead were foreign tourists.
Quoting the Channel News Asia website, PBS said eight suspects arrested so far included four Malaysians.
They were arrested on suspicion of helping smuggle bomb suspects out of Thailand after the August deadly bomb blast.
Channel News Asia said the Malaysian police announced, Thursday, that they had arrested eight people so far, some believed to be Uighurs.
Malaysia’s deputy inspector general of police, Noor Rashid Ibrahim, told media: “Four of them are foreign nationals, and the locals who were arrested were involved in ‘human trafficking’ brought these foreign nationals from Thailand into the country.”
He added: “Four of the eight are foreigners – I believe Uighurs – and they have been detained, but we haven’t been able to verify if they’re linked to the actual bombing in Thailand, as there hasn’t been any confessions.”
“So we’re detaining them and Thai authorities also know about the arrests to help them further their investigations.”  Rashid said so far there was “no concrete evidence” to show the suspects’ had any direct involvement with the Bangkok blast. They are accused of assisting the bombers to escape.
Police say they are working closely with the Thai police. Channel News Asia claimed Thai and Malaysian police met on Tuesday to discuss progress.
