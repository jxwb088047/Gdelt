Since the fatal shooting of unarmed, black teen Michael Brown at the hands of a local police officer, the town of Ferguson, Missouri, has erupted in unrest as citizens have taken to the streets in outrage for more than three days.

By Bill O\'Reilly

I came back from vacation because I am furious. Furious about how the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown is being reported and how various people are reacting to it. So let\'s run it down. Mr. Brown is a victim, shot six times by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson who up until August 9th had a very good record.

Now, some suspect Wilson of murder and a grand jury is hearing the case. Also, Attorney General Eric Holder went to Ferguson Missouri today to meet with FBI agents and state authorities who are conducting separate investigations. Good. The feds should look into this case. And their investigation should be transparent. That is Americans should get hard information as it comes out.

Which brings us to this video of Mr. Brown stealing from a convenience store and pushing the clerk around -- agitators call the release of the video a smear against Michael Brown and his family further inflaming the situation. But facts are not smears. And this goes to Mr. Brown\'s state of mind on the day he was killed. Americans have a right to know what happened leading up to the shooting.

You don\'t suppress an important piece of information in a case like this when only one side of the story is being reported by the media which is generally terrified of any racial situation.

Then there is the looting, disgraceful. And one guy even has a gun, all right, shoots the lock off the door while his cohorts break in and steal the merchandise. It doesn\'t get any lower than this. The people rioting and looting in Ferguson are dishonoring the memory of Michael Brown a...

Michael Brown Shooting: Tensions High In Ferguson | NBC News...
Tensions remain high in Ferguson, Missouri one week after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer. 

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot multiple times, sparking outrage from residents of this St. Louis suburb.

Shortly after 11:30 am, Dorian Johnson said he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street when a Ferguson police officer confronted them and told them to use the sidewalk. 

The officer then stopped his car only inches away from the pair and tried to open his door, but the door bounced off the pair and closed on the officer.

A struggle ensued and that’s when according to Johnson the officer, 28-year-old Darren Wilson, drew his weapon and and fired the first round, hitting Brown. The two ran off and Wilson continued after them. 

Johnson says he next hid behind the first car he saw and witnessed the officer get out of his vehicle, follow Brown and fire at the fleeing teen.

According to Johnson, an injured Brown next got on his knees and put his hands up to indicate he had no weapon. The officer continued shooting at Brown several times.

Ferguson police offer a different account. At a news conference Friday, Police released these images of Brown claiming he was involved in a strong arm robbery, stealing cigarellos from the nearby Ferguson Market around 15 minutes before the shooting.

Police say Wilson initially stopped the pair for jaywalking and was unaware Brown was a robbery suspect. It wasn’t until Wilson saw the stolen items in Brown’s hand, that he backed up to question the men further. 

Police said Brown physically...
