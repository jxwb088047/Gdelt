Thai police to simulate bombings as part of Bangkok blast investigation, AsiaOne Asia News
Experts investigate the Erawan shrine at the site of a deadly blast in central Bangkok, Thailand, August 18, 2015.
We are in the process of preparing materials for the simulations," deputy national police chief General Jakthip Chaijinda said yesterday.





 

The simulations would take place at Hoob Saboo explosion-testing area in Phetchaburi's Cha-am district, he said.
On August 17, an explosion rocked the Erawan Shrine at the Ratchaprasong Intersection, causing 20 deaths and injuring more than 100. Many of the victims were foreigners. On August 18, another blast exploded near the Sathorn Pier, but no one was injured. No arrests have been made yet in connection with either attack.
The court has already approved an arrest warrant for one man suspected of planting the bomb at the Erawan Shrine.
Jakthip said yesterday that police expected another arrest warrant to be issued within a week in connection with the explosion near Sathorn Pier. "We have not yet concluded whether the explosives in these two cases are the same type," he added.
Jakthip described the blast as a "world-level case", though he dismissed suggestions that the description was related to foreigners' plot to stage violence in Thailand. "No, it's not that. I used this description based on the fact that there were a high number of deaths, that such an attack has never occurred in Thailand before, and that it has gained the attention of so many countries," Jakthip said.
National police chief General Somyot Poompanmuang, meanwhile, said yesterday that police were still unable to confirm reports that a Turkish extremist group was to blame for the bombing. A foreign analyst said on Monday that the most likely motive behind the deadly bomb was the general dissatisfaction over the handling, both locally and in China, of the Uighur people who had fled to Thailand.
Anthony Davis, a Bangkok-based security analyst for IHS-Jane's, said the Erawan Shrine bombing on August 17 was possibly "a revenge attack on the Chinese and on the Thai state" by a hybrid group linked to elements in a pan-Turkic group called "The Grey Wolf" the Grey Wolves.
The group, according to Davis, is an "extreme right-wing fascist movement" that has links with organised crime. The Grey Wolves are also believed to have a paramilitary wing and chapters in some parts of Europe, including Berlin.
The Erawan Shrine bombing killed 20 people and injured more than 100 others, many of whom are still being treated.
Davis, who floated the hypothesis at a Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand panel discussion on Monday night about the bombing, said the recent attack on the Thai Consulate in Istanbul was directly related to Thailand's handling of the Uighur issue.
About a hundred Uighur people, who fled to Thailand in the hope of eventually going to Turkey, were forcibly repatriated by Thai authorities to China. "It is essentially a hybrid group. It doesn't have a clear organisational profile," Davis said of the bombers.
Wikipedia refers to the Grey Wolves as a Turkish nationalist organisation, with up to 1.9 million supporters, that has carried out some major operations, including assassinations and bombings. Davis explained that the Grey Wolves had a long-standing history of terrorism in Turkey, adding that the Erawan Shrine bomb was likely the work of a hybrid organisation that had somehow married the Wolves' capability with anger over the Uighur.
Police spokesman Pol Lt-General Prawut Thavornsiri, another panellist, said solving this case was very difficult because it was a first for Thailand. He added that making the bomb would have taken time, and the materials were not easy to find locally. He added that the suspect had tried to avoid facing the many surveillance cameras in the area, suggesting that it was a meticulously planned operation.
Prawut insisted the bomb could not have been just aimed at Chinese tourists. When questioned about the transparency of the investigation, he said the answer would come when the suspect is arrested. "It's just been seven days, not seven years," he said to the question posed by The Nation.
Two prime suspects in the Erawan Shrine bomb attack that killed 20 and injured more than 100 people re-enacted the crime at 19 key spots in Bangkok.
Adem Karadag, or Bilal Muhammed, who was the first suspect arrested in connection with the August 17 attack in an apartment in Min Buri
and Mieraili Yusufu, the second suspect arrested at the beginning of this month near the Cambodia border at Sa Kaew's Aranyaprathet district,
were taken to re-enact the crime at key spots where they confessed to committing the crime
Adem's confession was in line with Mieraili's confession and Adem's statements also implicated others in the bombing gang.
Adem started the re-enactment outside the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel where he allegedly got off a tuk-tuk; the second spot was at the Erawan Shrine where Adem placed a bag containing the bomb.
Mieraili was brought to Rama I Road, opposite the Erawan Shrine.
National police chief General Somyot Poompanmuang said the suspects had confessed because they were confronted with evidence.
He said the motive for the bombing was the crackdown on human trafficking, which put an end to the illegal business.
The suspects were part of the human-trafficking ring and might have been hired by an ill-intentioned group to commit the crime.
A foreign man described as a "main suspect" in the deadly Bangkok bombing was arrested, with Thai police calling him an important figure in the network that staged the attack.
The man detained near the border with Cambodia is the second foreigner held over the blast at a religious shrine in central Bangkok which killed 20 people, mostly ethnic Chinese tourists.
Police also said arrest warrants have been issued for three fresh suspects still at large, two of whom have names which appear foreign.

Police probing Thailand's deadliest bombing widened their net in the search for more suspects
after a foreigner was arrested and stacks of fake passports and bomb-making materials were found during a raid on a Bangkok apartment block.
The 28-year-old man, who has been in Thailand since January 2014, was detained on charges of possessing illegal explosives.
Police and residents in Bangkok's Nong Chok district said the suspect rented four apartments on the same floor of the rundown building.
The detained man was reclusive but always appeared focused and walked with intent on his rare forays outside.
Police arrested a foreign man on Saturday they said fitted the description of a suspect seen leaving a rucksack at the site of the Bangkok blast nearly two weeks ago.
Police raided an apartment in a northern suburb of the capital on Saturday afternoon and discovered possible bomb-making materials that could have been used in the Aug. 17 attack in Bangkok's bustling commercial heart.
Police say the suspect is ‘unlikely’ international terrorist, but spurred by ‘personal feud’.
Thai monks led prayers Wednesday for the reopening of Bangkok shrine where a blast killed 20 people, as police hunted a man shown on security footage calmly planting what is believed to be the bomb.
The bomb struck early on Monday evening as worshippers and tourists crowded into the Erawan shrine in the Thai capital's commercial heart, but no-one has yet claimed responsibility.
The unprecedented attack on the Thai capital left at least 11 foreigners dead, with Chinese, Hong Kong, Singaporean, Indonesian and a family from Malaysia among the victims.
More than 100 other people were wounded by a blast that shredded bodies and incinerated motorcycles at one of the city's busiest intersections.
Police said a second explosion at a Bangkok pier on Tuesday that caused no injuries may be linked, deepening fears for Bangkok residents with police conceding they do not know who was responsible.
Around a dozen Buddhist monks led prayers at the Erawan shrine as it re-opened early Wednesday while devotees - including tourists - genuflected and held joss sticks, and AFP reporter said.
A relative of the dead Malaysians had laid bundles of clothes at the shrine to represent the lost loved ones, according to a monk.
The shrine - a popular tourist attraction that typifies the kingdom's unusual blend of Hindu and Buddhist traditions - and its surrounding had already been largely restored.
Twisted iron railings were the only immediate sign of the carnage, which police believe was caused by a bomb made up of three kilogrammes of explosives and ball bearings.
One devotee had more reason than most to give thanks.
Tommy Goh, 56, a Thai-Malaysian from Penang, said only a delayed taxi from his hotel spared him from being at the shrine around the time of the blast.
"Every year I come down to this shrine, we were meant to be here around 6.50-7pm but the taxi didn't arrive from the hotel... so we went somewhere else," he told AFP.
"Ten minutes later and it could have been so different." Police released images Tuesday showing a man, apparently young, slightly built and wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark shorts, walking into the shrine with a backpack.
In the video he calmly places the backpack underneath a bench and then walks away clutching a blue plastic bag and what looks like a smartphone.
The bomb exploded several minutes later, leading Thailand police to make the man their prime suspect.
A small explosion on Tuesday by a bridge at the city's Chaopraya river has been tied to Monday's bomb.
Colonel Kamthorn Ouicharoen, of Thai bomb squad police confirmed the bridge bomb was same type as that detonated at the Erawan Shrine "It's exactly the same, the equipment used to make it, the bomb size," he said.
Thailand has experienced a near-decade long political crisis that has seen endless rounds of street violence.
A festering insurgency by Muslim rebels in the Thai south has claimed 6,400 victims, but is a highly localised conflict.
A small explosive was thrown from a bridge over the Chao Phraya River in central Bangkok on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported.
The unidentified man threw the explosive near the busy Sathorn Pier on the city’s Chao Phraya River and it landed in a canal.
The incident came a day after a fatal bomb blast at a city shrine.
CCTV footage shows people scattering as they cross the bridge.
The man was filmed on CCTV near the Erewan shrine.
He was first wearing a backpack, and later appeared without it.
The bomb was reportedly planted inside the Erawan shrine, which is situated just at the corner of the Ratchaprasong intersection and in front of the Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok hotel, an area that many tourists would be familiar with.
A Singaporean woman was killed in the bomb blast that rocked Bangkok's Ratchaprasong area on Monday night, reported local media.
According to a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some Singaporeans were injured in the incident.

MFA said its embassy staff are providing consular assistance to affected Singaporeans.
Dozens of tourists were injured in the bombing, which appeared to have been targeted at foreigners.
MFA urged Singaporeans in Bangkok to take necessary safety precautions, avoid the vicinity of the explosion and to monitor the local news closely
A video has emerged online of a Chinese tourist's first-hand experience of the bomb that exploded at one of Bangkok's most popular shrines on Monday.
Posted on Shanghaiist's Facebook page, the video initially shows a regular scene of pedestrians walking on the sky bridge.
Then, at the 25th second, there is a sudden loud explosion that rocks the place and balls of fire could be seen.
Screams could be heard in the background and scenes of panic could be seen from the footage.
The male tourist shooting the video could be heard speaking in Mandarin, asking: "What's the situation?"
The bomb was detonated at about 7pm (8pm, Singapore time) in the middle of the city's rush hour, sending a fireball into the sky as commuters and tourists fled in panic.
The bomb was reportedly planted inside the Erawan shrine, which is situated just at the corner of the Ratchaprasong intersection and in front of the Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok hotel, an area that many tourists would be familiar with.
The Erawan is an enormously popular shrine to the Hindu god Brahma but is visited by thousands of Buddhist devotees every day.
It is a major attraction for tourists from East Asia, especially China. Built in 1956, it is one of the Thai capital's top tourist attractions.
National police chief Somyot Poompanmuang told reporters the attack was unprecedented in Thailand.
A bomb on a motorcycle exploded on Monday just outside a Hindu shrine in the centre of the Thai capital, killing at least 12 people, police and a rescue worker said.
The blast was near the Erawan shrine at a major Bangkok intersection, police said.
"All I can say now is there has been an explosion in central Bangkok involving a motorcycle bomb," deputy national police chief Aek Angsananond told Reuters.
He said there had been fatalities, but could not confirm details.
A policeman at the scene and a rescue worker said 12 people had been killed.
A Reuters witness at the scene said she saw pieces of human flesh near the blast site, and a soldier later told onlookers to move back, saying they were checking for a second bomb.
Thai forces are fighting a low-level Muslim insurgency in the predominantly Buddhist country's south, although those rebels have rarely launched attacks outside their ethnic Malay heartland.
The country has also been riven for a decade by intense and sometimes violent rivalry between political factions in Bangkok and elsewhere.
The army has ruled Thailand since May 2014, when it ousted an elected government after months of, at times, violent anti-government protests.
The Erawan shrine, on a busy corner near top hotels, shopping centres and offices, is a major tourist attraction, especially for visitors from East Asia.
This file photo taken on September 9, 1999 shows tourists paying homage to the Erawan Shrine in central Bangkok.
Thai police have said the bomb was made of 5kg of TNT explosive.
A source said the bomb was hidden under a roadside bench in front of the Erawan shrine.
The explosion had a radius of 40 metres, the source added.
Nation TV reported that the death toll rose to 15.
The Red Cross Society issued an urgent plea for the people to donate blood Tuesday as a lot of blood supplies are needed for the victims of the explosion.
