China to celebrate 60th anniversary of Xinjiang's autonomy - People's Daily Online

 BEIJING, Sept. 24Â  -- China's top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng will lead a central government delegation to attend festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said an official on Thursday.

 Hu Kaihong, a spokesperson of the State Council Information Office, said at a press conference that a series of activities, including a grand ceremony, will be held from Sept. 25 to Oct. 1. A white paper summarizing Xinjiang's decades of development was also released at the press conference.

 Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, vowed on Wednesday to continue assistance to Xinjiang to maintain stability and prosperity in the northwestern region.

 The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was founded on Oct. 1, 1955, after the local legislature elected the first regional government leadership.
