This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. China has issued a white paper on the ethnic equality, unity and developments there over the six decades. 
The paper says the principle of equality among all ethnic groups has been upheld. It notes the number of ethnic minority officials has increased nine times, now accounting for more than half of the total. 
Xinjiang has achieved steady and rapid economic development. Its gross domestic product, or GDP, has had an annual growth rate of 8.3 percent. That's higher than the national average. The infrastructure has also been upgraded. 
In 2014, over 175 kilometers of highways were open to traffic. Railway lines reached 5,760 kilometers. And 16 civil airports are in operation. 
The report also details improvements in other sectors including environmental protection, public health, and education.
