Thailand bombing suspects arrested in Malaysia - Malaysiakini
Two suspects in last month's Erawan shrine bombing in Thailand have been arrested in Malaysia, according to Bangkok Post.
The report said the two suspects were arrested by Malaysian police.
Citing Thai police sources, it said Thai authorities were informed about the arrest by their Malaysian counterparts yesterday. It is unclear when and where the duo was arrested.
It added that Pol Lt Gen Suchart Teerasawat has led a police team to seek Malaysia's help.
"The source said Pol Lt Gen Suchart is now in Yala, waiting for Malaysia to inform him if they are going to extradite the suspects to Thailand," said the report.
The report said the suspects were believed to have fled Thailand through Narathiwat's Sungai Kolok district.
In a related development, the report said Bangkok had also contacted their counterparts in China to capture the "mastermind" of the bombing.
Thai police have to date arrested two suspects, Karadag, 28, also known as Bilal Mohammed and Yusufu Mieraili, 25.
The Aug 17 bombing killed 20 people and injured 125 others. Five of the dead were Malaysians and were part of a seven-member family visiting Thailand.
Thai police have ruled out international militants as responsible for the attack but have not said why nor what they believe the motive was.
The use of Chinese passports by suspects arrested by Thai police, at least one of which stated Xinjiang as a birthplace, adds fuel to speculation the bombing may have been a revenge attack by sympathisers of Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslims.
Thailand was widely condemned in July for forcibly repatriating 109 Uighurs to China, where they say they are persecuted. Many Uighurs from western China’s Xinjiang region travel though South-East Asia to get to Turkey.
