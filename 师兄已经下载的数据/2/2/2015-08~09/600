Thai police blame media for hindering bomb probe

Claim chief suspect always one step ahead as media keep giving advance reports of police movements; media, meanwhile, say they are given the reports by police
BANGKOK - Thailand'sÂ deputy national police chief has blamedÂ media for jeopardizing the investigation into the Aug.Â 17 Bangkok bombing, claiming that the chief suspectÂ is always one step ahead of investigators as media keep giving advance reports of police movements.
Last week, media -- based on informationÂ the Bangkok Post says police gave out --Â saidÂ thatÂ the yellow-shirtedÂ suspectedÂ bomber thought to have targeted the Erawan shrine in the blast that killed 20 -- had fled to MalaysiaÂ with the help of Thai and Malaysian nationals, clearly rilingÂ Gen.Â Chakthip Chaijinda -- who will becomeÂ police chiefÂ Oct.Â 1.Â 
"Honestly, I regret [that we wasted so much time]... he [the suspect] is now like a free bird and we don't know where he is heading to. I believe the suspected bomber has already fled Malaysia," theÂ Post reported him saying at a press conference Friday.
"Last week, I was one hundred percent sure [of arresting him], but this week we have to start all over again," said Chakthip.Â 
âGo ahead, report more on in-depth information of the investigation, and police will find it even harder to catch the suspects...Â If there had not been reports about suspects fleeing here and there, they would have been arrested last week."
With regard to the ongoing investigation,Â Chakthip said it is also still unclear if Malaysian authorities will allow Thai officials to question three suspects detained in the country on suspicion of human trafficking.
On Thursday,Â an arrest warrant - the 13thÂ in the case - was issuedÂ for a man named as "Abdul Tawab" who police claim isÂ a Pakistani citizen.Â 
Police sayÂ they considerÂ TawabÂ a suspect because of financialÂ transactions between him and a personÂ Thai police have described asÂ a Turkish citizen whose Thai wife rented theÂ apartment where bomb-making materials were found during a police raidÂ Aug.Â 29.
The Bangkok Post reportedÂ Friday that Tawab is âbelieved to be the leader of the human trafficking network that smuggled UighurÂ into a third country through Thailandâ.Â 
The Post also said that Tawab is believed to have arranged the escape of at least two suspects from the Kingdom.
So far, Thai police have arrestedÂ three suspects -- aÂ 28-year-oldÂ man, who has told his lawyer that he was born in Xinjiang,Â theÂ north-westernÂ Chinese province which is home to the MuslimÂ Uighur minority, but has since become a Turkish citizen; another man,Â arrestedÂ Sept.Â 1 near the Cambodian border andÂ holding a Chinese passport with Xinjiang as birthplace, and a Thai national from the country's southÂ who is suspected by police of being a âkey personâ in a people smuggling network.
Uighur living in Xinjiang claimÂ their cultural and religious rights are being curtailed by Chinese authorities,Â and thousands of them have fled with the aid of people smugglers,Â some to settle in Turkey.
Bangkok deported 109 UighurÂ to China in July, separating families, troublingÂ human rights groups, and infuriating Uighur organizations worldwide.
Thai police chief General Somyot Pumpanmuang told reporters at a press conference TuesdayÂ that there was a connection between the deportation and the bombing, but he backtrackedÂ Wednesday after reportedlyÂ beingÂ brought to heel by junta chief-cum-prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
He has since repeatedÂ anÂ earlier narrative that the attack - which killed 20 - was an act ofÂ revenge by people smugglers whose interests wereÂ affected by a crackdown on human trafficking.
