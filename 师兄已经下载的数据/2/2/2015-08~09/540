After four-plus years of fighting, Syria\'s war has killed at least 250,000 people and displaced 12 million people. And, though it started as a civil war, it\'s become much more than that. It\'s a proxy war that has divided much of the Middle East, and has drawn in both Russia and the United States.

As Syria’s civil war has raged over the past four years, more than a million refugees have fled into neighboring Lebanon. The Bekaa Valley, which serves as the main passageway between Damascus and Beirut, is now home to the largest concentration of Lebanon’s Syrian refugees.

Currently in Lebanon there is one Syrian for every four Lebanese citizens — a population growth that has created a strain on the small villages and towns that bear the responsibility of hosting the refugees. Al Marj, a small city of about 15,000 in the southern end of the Bekaa Valley, is home to a refugee camp where approximately 400 families are living.

VICE News traveled to the Bekaa Valley to see how the refugee population is faring as winter fully sets in, and found that the freezing temperatures are only one of their problems.

Since the beginning of the conflict, Syrian children have been the forgotten victims of the horrific war. Today, over 5 million children are in need of assistance, including over 1 million Syrian children who have sought refuge in neighboring countries. These children are at risk of becoming a \"lost generation\" and cannot be ignored. We must save Syria\'s children.

A MUST HEAR! PLEASE LISTEN AND FORWARD! 
Questions this broadcast answers:
1.) Why would Syrian refugees make the dangerous and extremely long journey to European nations and U.S. (who hold damnable doctrine and life-styles according to the Quran) rather than the Arab nations (who are Islamic oriented) around them? 
2.) Why has it taken 5 full years (length of civil war in certain parts of Syria) for Syrians in the particular regions to leave?
3.) Why are refugees tossing out good water and food given to them by western governments on their arrival?
4.) Why are many of the refugees young men?
5.) Why are the 5 wealthiest Gulf Nations refusing to take even one refugee? What do they know that we don\'t?
6.) Could it be this refugee crisis is not really a crisis at all but a Trojan Horse?
7.) Could it be that we could be looking at the most massive Infiltration of Muslims and the religion of Islam the West has EVER seen in History
8.) Could it be this \"refugee crisis\" is a planned takeover by the United Nations, U.S. and EU sensitive to the Caliphate of Islamic Teachings?
9.) Could it be that due to Russian intervention in the Syrian war backing Assad this Exodus of Syrians is due to a major surprise all-out attack to be launched by the U.S. and Nato in Syria making Damascus a \"ruinous heap\"?
10.) Does the China and Russia warships spotted off the coast of Alaska and Georgia U.S. last week indicate something far more threatening and sinister is about to take place on the global scene?
Tune in and get the answers to these questions and much more!

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as The UN Refugee Agency is a United Nations agency mandated to protect and support refugees at the request of a government or the UN itself and assists in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland and is a member of the United Nations Development Group. The UNHCR has won two Nobel Peace Prizes, once in 1954 and again in 1981.
Following the demise of the League of Nations and the formation of the United Nations, the international community were acutely aware of the refugee crisis following the end of World War II. In 1947, the International Refugee Organization(IRO) was founded by the United Nations. The IRO was the first international agency to deal comprehensively with all aspects pertaining to refugees' lives. Preceding this was the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which was established in 1944 to address the millions of people displaced through Europe as a result of World War II.
