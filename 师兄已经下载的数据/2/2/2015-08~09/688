Bangkok - Thailand's junta chief on Tuesday said authorities
are hunting a "suspect" seen on CCTV footage near the scene of a bombing
that claimed at least 22 lives in Bangkok and wounded scores more.
"Today there is a suspect who appeared on CCTV but it's
not clear... we are looking for this guy," he said, adding the suspect was
believed to be from an "anti-government group based in Thailand's
northeast" - the heartland of the kingdom's anti-coup Red Shirt movement.
Thai authorities have also not ruled out any group,
including elements opposed to the military government. Officials said the
bombing did not match tactics used by insurgents in the south.
Eight foreigners were among those killed by the bombing at a
popular shrine on Monday evening, an attack that could hurt Thailand's vital tourism
industry.
Police teams were deployed to the blood-splattered site
early on Tuesday, some wearing white gloves and carrying plastic bags,
searching for clues.
"Police are not ruling out anything including [Thai]
politics and the conflict of ethnic Uighurs who, before this, Thailand sent
back to China," National Police Chief Somyot Pumpanmuang told reporters.
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of the Turkic-speaking and
largely Muslim minority have fled unrest in China's western Xinjiang region,
where hundreds of people have been killed, prompting a crackdown by Chinese
authorities. Many Uighurs have travelled through Southeast Asia to Turkey.
Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters there
were "still anti-government groups out there" but gave no further
details.
Officials have not blamed any group for the bombing at the
Erawan shrine, which the government called a bid to destroy the economy. No one
has claimed responsibility.
Prayuth said the attack, which took place during rush hour
in the capital's bustling commercial hub, was unprecedented in Thailand.
Police Chief Somyot said the blast was caused by a pipe
bomb.
National police spokesperson Prawut Thavornsiri said the
death toll stood at 22, with 123 people wounded.
Three Chinese were among the dead, China's official Xinhua
news agency said. Two Hong Kong residents, two people from Malaysia and one
person from the Philippines also died, officials said. Scores of people were
wounded, including many from China and Taiwan.
Thailand has been riven for a decade by a sometimes violent
struggle for power between political factions in Bangkok.
Occasional small blasts have been blamed on one side or the
other. Two pipe bombs exploded outside a luxury shopping mall in the same area
in February, but caused little damage.
Thai forces are also fighting a low-level Muslim insurgency
in the predominantly Buddhist country's south, but those rebels have rarely
launched attacks outside their heartland.
"This does not match with incidents in southern
Thailand. The type of bomb used is also not in keeping with the south,"
Royal Thai Army chief and deputy defence minister General Udomdej Sitabutr said
in a televised interview.
