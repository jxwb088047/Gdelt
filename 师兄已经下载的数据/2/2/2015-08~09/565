Personality the key to Chinese wine industry’s growth::winesinfo
Chinese wine producers need to develop their own personality in order to compete in the world stage, according to Wang Zuming, president of wine branch of China Alcohol Drinks Association.
‘When people talk about Riesling, their minds go to Germany. Why? Because competitiveness comes from personality’, said Wang during a field visit a vineyard of Zhongfei, a Xinjiang winery.
Based in the vast Xinjiang desert, Zhongfei produces award-winning wines in competitions like Decanter World Wine Awards and Concours Mondial de Bruxelles.
Acknowledging Zhongfei’s outstanding achievements, Wang pointed out the long way that Xinjiang region has to go before being recognized as a world-class with region with distinct personality.
