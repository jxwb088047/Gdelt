Thai police seek ‘Chinese’ man over Bangkok bomb - Newspaper - DAWN.COM
BANGKOK: Thai police on Saturday said an arrest warrant had been issued for a “Chinese” man over last month’s deadly Bangkok blast, backtracking after they earlier identified the suspect as a member of the country’s Uighur minority.
Confusing and sometimes contradictory official statements have characterised updates into the investigation of the attack which killed 20 people, the majority ethnic Chinese visitors, at a religious shrine in the capital’s bustling downtown district on August 17.
Analysts have increasingly pointed towards militants from China’s mostly Muslim Uighur minority — or their supporters — in reve­nge for Thailand’s forced dep­ or­tation of 109 Uighur refugees to an uncertain future in China in July.

So the Thais deported the Uighar out of their country then bombed innocent people of other religion.How low can one go.
