Prayut says Bangkok bombing possibly related to Uighur smuggling
The NationBANGKOK: -- Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said Friday that the Erawan Shrine bombing might be related to the Uighur smuggling.
"Possibly. But all were possible. It might be related our own problem or related to a smuggling movement," Prayut said when reporters asked him whether the attack was related to Uighur smuggling gang.
Prayut said he did not want Thailand to be a transit point of irregular movements of migrants because conflicts could later occur.
Prayut added that the mass media should avoid making wild speculation about the case or they could further complicate the investigation.

'Prayut added that the mass media should avoid making wild speculation about the case or they could further complicate the investigation'
The police and army are already doing a great job of that. 
You do know that he can not and will not think outside of the box, right?
You were trying to blame it on red shirts not but a day after the bombings were you not general? 
Maybe think before speaking next time. Difficult concept I know.

It's not about the smuggling it's about the fact that Thailand in its infinite wisdom handed Uighur back to China probably to face a firing squad. It's not about the smuggling ring, but pay back for costing refugee runaways their lives.
 That seems to be their answer to everything. Don't like something? Bomb, maim and destroy.

But i thought that they have got the guilty person and ALREADY, and they have  paid out the ransome money to the RTP, so why is "Dear leader" still trying to guess who did it ?  

Has anyone checked to see who has been paying the phone bills in Turkey?
But don't whatever you do speculate or it might cause trouble, or maybe it won't?
Just a passing thought, nothing ensures a trouble free smuggling operation like bombing a major city and starting a worldwide terrorist manhunt.
I would like to speculate that this is a domestic power struggle and the Uighurs are patsies. Human trafficking in Thailand is managed by the military for profit. So they know who the participants are. Uighurs may have been coerced to get involved but factions in the military call the shots and provide the explosive. Some people in the military don't like Prayut. He is now using an armoured car as he knows the silent counter-coup has begun.

To admit it happened because Thailand sent 100+ Uighurs back into the hands of the people the Uighur were fleeing from , would be an admission of a massive error of judgemnt
Be a man, just admit it that you screwed up by sending back the Uighurs to China.

Well, that decision was questionable for sure, but please be careful about rationalizing terrorism against innocent civilians.

the Uighurs were not only to be handed to Turkey, they probably all without exception were going to join the ISIS ranks.  Turkey and Thailand only acting as transit lands.  Turkey is supporting ISIS despite all the diplomatic brainwashing in the background, it is obvious

Its more important to the current Thai leader, its under his watch, his decision and his choice to cosy up to China, resulting in the Thai embassy being attacked in Turkey and Thai citizens in Turkey along with Chinese both warned by their respective governments to be extra careful.
So Mr P and co were well aware of the reaction of handing the Uigur  back to China long before any bomb yet they failed to take security measures in their own country... and thats when people died.
How can Thai government can be seen to be anything but the definitive factor behind the bomb going off ? they know this, that is what the covering up is all about.
This mess is entirely at the current leaders feet and caused by decisions re China, thats why people have died and thats why the gov is hiding the stark and simple truth.
What goes around comes around or karma its about as Buddhist concept as you can get,unsurprisingly Thailand never saw it coming... again.

You bought that one hook line and sinker, who did you believe the Chinese or the Thais ? When they tried to cover up their action against the Uighur by touting that rubbish
Failed Thai policies provoking international terrorism? Masquerading as "revenge" against Thailand? Seeking to "harm" Thailand? Which is it?
