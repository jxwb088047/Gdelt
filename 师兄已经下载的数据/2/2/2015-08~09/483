New Atheists & Sarah Palin Agree: Arrest Clock-Wielding Muslims Just In Case
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 22, 20154 Comments
Some fear-mongering against muslims is done by atheists. Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher provided recent examples.
Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Over the weekend, both Dawkins and Maher eagerly leapt to question the motives of Ahmed Mohamed, the Texas teen who was handcuffed and arrested for suspicion of bringing “a hoax bomb” to school when he showed up with a homemade clock. Mohamed’s story — one in which a school system that already had a history ofquestionable sentiments toward Islam had an overreaction to a scientifically Muslim curious kid — has become an international news story, culminating Mohamed receiving an invitation from the president to the White House. But where some have seen an outpouring of support for an inventive 14 year-old kid, others have wondered if there isn’t something a little more… suspicious going on here.”*
Cenk, I hope you read this because I think you are being horribly unfair.
At first, I was just as outraged about the Ahmed story because it sounded like a kid had spent a lot of time building a clock to was arrested because teachers overreacted and thought it was a bomb.
However, after taking some time to read about the story I found that the initial narrative does not match the facts.
1. Ahmed did not “MAKE” a clock. He took a clock out of its case and put it inside a metal case`.

2. Ahmed took the case to school and showed his engineering teacher. Who said that it was cool, but that he should not have brought it to school because it looks suspicious and he should keep it put away during class.
3. He then took the case to other classes and showed it to students, but when he set the alarm off during English class, the teacher asked him what it was and he did not answer. She sent him to the principals office and called the police because she thought Ahmed had created a fake bomb and brought it to school..
Those are the facts. So judging by the facts I believe there are a couple of possible scenarios.
A. Ahmed took a clock out of its manufactured housing and put it into a metal case in order to make it look like a hollywood movie style suitcase bomb with the intention of frightening or intimidating fellow classmates a couple days after September 11th. Why? Perhaps he was mistreated and called a terrorist a couple days before and decided to bring it as a prank to get back at students who joshed him about his religion.
B. He took the clock apart and put it into a metal case in order to impress other students by claiming that he had created it. He then naively failed to realize that putting it into a metal case may make it look like a movie style bomb.
Although plausible the latter seems very bizarre. I don’t think it is fair to criticize Professor Dawkins for questioning his motivations because it seems very strange or unlikely that a kid would take apart a clock to claim he made it.
While I would agree that calling the police was inappropriate, it is only a matter of course for our “Zero-tolerance society” that treats every perceived threat as a serious crime. It’s not hard to imagine that any other student would be treated just as harshly, because sometimes they want to send a message (to other students that there will be “ZERO” tolerance).
Cenk manages to malign Maher with this latest tirade by:
 a) Conflating Maher’s calm, factual statements with Dawkins’ racially tinged tweets (inherently a dishonest tactic). Dawkins sounds like he’s entered nutville; Maher’s take is reasoned and well-founded.
 b) Distorting Maher’s calm view of the matter. Per Maher: That nerdy kid sounds cool, it was a terrible error to arrest him (“they owed him an apology, no doubt about it”), and that the metal box with wires, digital counter and a circuit board sticking out of it did, yes, to the untrained eye, “looked exactly like a bomb.”
 c) Conveniently ignoring a basic fact: As Maher said, “For the last 30 years, it’s been one culture that has been blowing shit up over and over again.”
It’s really dismaying to see Cenk and so many other progressives fail to honestly confront or at least try to refute the terrorism that has has become endemic to Islamic fundamentalism. Instead, people like Cenk put up smokescreens and rant wildly about bigotry — anything to avoid a basic fact: “For the last 30 years, it’s been one culture that has been blowing shit up over and over again.”

This is a story that made respectable people to call upon belief and not rationality, as they do not most of the time. As Bill Maher said (paraphrasing): I cannot understand a neurosurgeon who believes in a 5000 years old Earth. In their defense, (Bill Maher and Richard Dawkings) they made a mistake on judging the project from Hollywood footage. (if it was a round clock it would look like a timer for TNT or C4). Bill Maher is right when he says that brilliant people with conviction blew things up, but, the common issue was always segregation. (you are not one of us)
If there is any chance that a 14 year old child would speak up after he is handcuffed, and not listen to people who really care for him in a distressing moment (his sister), I would like to meet him.
Yes, it looks like a bomb, like any device that has a chip that counts impulses an can be attached to something that blows.
In a nutshell “Do not judge a book by its cover”
this is my opinion on this case.
P.S. Did somebody measure the manure in that child”s pants when he was arrested?
I am saddened that they both are pro suspicion when it comes to muslims. Their anti-islamic attitudes do not reflect well on them. That said, both when out of their way to say that the kid should NOT have been arrested over this. I think your headline is somewhat misleading.
