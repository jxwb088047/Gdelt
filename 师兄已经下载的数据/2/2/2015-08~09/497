ABC News’ Martha Raddatz reports from Jordan on efforts to contain ISIS, and an inside look at ISIS recruiting.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL /ˈaɪsəl/) is a jihadist rebel group that controls territory in Iraq and Syria and also operates in eastern Libya, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and other areas of the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The group\'s Arabic name is transliterated as ad-Dawlah al-Islāmīyah fī al-‘Irāq wash-Shām leading to the Arabic acronym Da‘ish or DAESH (Arabic pronunciation: da:ʕeʃ). The name is also commonly translated as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS /ˈaɪsɪs/). In June 2014 ,the group renamed itself the Islamic State (IS), but the new name has been widely criticized and condemned, with the UN, various governments, and mainstream Muslim groups refusing to use it.

The United Nations has held ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a \"historic scale\". The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, India, and Russia. Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL.

ISIS linked to second Bangladesh murder, government in damage control mode

Days after the Islamic State was linked to the murder of an Italian national out for a jog in Dhaka, the terrorist group has laid claim to another murder. This weekend, Hoshi Kunio was shot in Kaunia town in Rangpur on Saturday.

SITE Intelligence Group, a US monitoring organization linked the deadly act to ISIS, after the group claimed responsibility on Twitter. As mentioned previously, western intelligence organizations has linked both murders to the Islamic State, while Bangladesh authorities refute the notions.

Sydney shooting linked to terror

Friday afternoon, a civilian police employee was killed outside a Sydney police station. The perpetrator shot Curtis Cheng, a 58-year-old long-time employee in the finance department. New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told the media a \"deliberately, targeted attack\" was carried out in which Cheng was murdered at close range while leaving police headquarters on Charles Street in Parramatta. The gunman shot the employee with a single bullet, his motive is currently unknown.
