Police link Uighur deportations to Bangkok bombing | theSundaily
BANGKOK: Thailand’s deportation of ethnic Uighurs to China was a motive behind the terrorist bombing that left 20 dead and scores injured in Bangkok last month, police said today.
The deportation of 109 members of the ethnic minority in July disrupted the operations of human traffickers smuggling the refugees into the country, Thai National Police Chief Somyot Poompanmouang said.
“The traffickers are angry that we destroyed their businesses and angry that police shut down their illegal networks.”
He defended the deportations, saying Thailand “should not be used as a transit point” for trafficking.
The crackdown on illegal migration could also be linked to the storming of the Thai consulate in Istanbul in July by related networks, he said.
Last week, police asked reporters not to link the bombing to Uighurs.
Security specialists have said a Uighur connection is likely in the Aug 17 attack, but as an act of solidarity from other Muslim groups, rather than revenge by traffickers.
Some have speculated that the most likely culprits were extremist Turkish groups, claims previously denied by Thai authorities.
On Monday, police said the alleged bombing mastermind had fled to Turkey, not China as previously reported.
Chinese national Abudusataer Abudureheman, 27, also known as Ishan, has been identified by other suspects as the main organizer of the attack.
Somyot said Abudureheman was likely supported by elements of his human trafficking networks that operated in Turkey. Uighurs in north-western China speak a language related to Turkish. Many say they suffer discrimination at the hands of authorities and the dominant Han Chinese majority.
Thai police also sent a team to Malaysia to assist in the interrogation of Malaysian man and woman and a Pakistani man detained in connection with the bombing. – dpa
