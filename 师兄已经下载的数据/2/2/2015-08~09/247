ARRAS, FRANCE — Several passengers, including three Americans, thwarted a possible massacre on a high-speed train on Friday when gunman, Ayoub El Khazzani, opened fire while the train was traveling near the French town of Arras.

On a high-speed Thalys train bound for Paris, El Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan national, loaded his Kalashnikov assault rifle in the bathroom of car 12. Besides the assault rifle, the shirtless gunman also had nine magazines of ammunition, a Luger automatic pistol, ammunition for the pistol and a box cutter on him.

One passenger, 51-year-old professor Mark Magoolian, met El Khazzani as he was leaving the bathroom and wrestled away the Kalashnikov. But then El Khazzani took out his sidearm and shot Magoolian in the back of the neck.

El Khazzani strolled down the aisle in the train’s carriage and tried to discharge his Kalashnikov, which was jammed. Three Americans saw the gunman, and seeing that his gun appeared to be jammed, charged at him from their seats approximately nine metres away.

One was able to grab El Khazzani around the neck, immobilizing him, while another grabbed the handgun and threw it away during the tussle. He then picked up El Khazzani’s Kalashnikov and proceeded to hit him in the head with it. During the struggle, El Khazzani was able to pull out his box cutter and cut one of the Americans several times, but the neither of the trio received any life-threatening injuries. 

Eventually the passengers were able to subdue El Khazzani and tied up his arms and legs. Another passenger, a British man, was hurt while helping to subd...

The three American men who are being hailed as heroes for thwarting an attack on a Amsterdam-Paris train said the gunman could have done a lot more harm had they not acted on instinct and ambushed the gunman.

\"The guy had a lot of ammo. His intentions were pretty clear,\" said Alek Skarlatos, who with fellow Americans Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, and a British man, Chris Norman, rushed an assailant on the high speed train after they heard a gunshot Friday.

\"It looked like he just kept pulling more weapons left and right,\" Stone echoed.

\"He never said a word ... we saw him cocking the AK-47, so at that time it was either do something or die,\" said Sadler. \"Hiding or sitting back is not going to accomplish anything.\"

The three spoke at a news conference Sunday at the U.S. ambassador\'s residence in Paris.

French Interior Minister Brenard Cazeneuve said the suspect, 26-year-old Moroccan Ayoub El Khazzani might have links to radical Islam, but his lawyer said on French television that he was merely trying to rob the train.

\"It doesn\'t take eight magazines to rob a train,\" Sadler said. \"The gunman would have been successful if my friend Spencer hadn\'t gotten up,\" he added.

Stone recalled being asleep when he heard a gunshot and acting immediately when Skarlatos hit him on the shoulder and said, \"let\'s go.\" At that point, the gun \"looked like it was jammed,\" Stone said.

Stone, a first class airman, and Skarlatos, an Oregon National Guardsman said their military training didn\'t come into play until after the gunman was subdued.

YOUR DESCRIPTION HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF CHARACTERS ALLOWED AND WAS CUT. PARIS (AP) -- The president of France pinned his country\'s highest award, the Legion d\'Honneur, on three Americans and a Briton on Monday, saying they \"gave a lesson in courage\" by subduing a heavily armed attacker on a high-speed train carrying 500 passengers to Paris. President Francois Hollande said that while two of the Americans who tackled the gunman were soldiers, \"on Friday you were simply passengers. You behaved as soldiers but also as responsible men.\" Hollande then pinned the medals on U.S. Airman Spencer Stone, National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and their longtime friend Anthony Sadler. All took part in subduing the gunman as he moved through the Amsterdam-to-Paris train with an assault rifle strapped to his bare chest. British businessman Chris Norman, who jumped into the fray, also received the medal. The Americans looked earnest and slightly overwhelmed - and a little under-dressed - for the unanticipated event in the ornate Elysee Palace. Their short-sleeved polo shirts and khakis contrasted with the gilded and velvet-curtained ceremonial hall as Hollande read out their names one by one - and kissed them on each cheek, in French style. It was an unusual ceremony for the French president\'s office too, as dozens of photographers loudly shouted out the Americans\' names as they approached Hollande standing on the steps of the palace- unlike the quieter, more-subdued welcome for visiting heads of state. The four men listened to a translation of Hollande\'s speech through earpieces, and the v...

A railway or railroad train is a connected series of vehicles for rail transport that move along a track (permanent way) to transport cargo or passengers from one place to another place. The track usually consists of two, three or four rails, but might also be a monorail or maglev guideway.
Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate locomotive, or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most modern trains are powered by diesel locomotives or by electricity supplied by overhead wires or additional rails, although historically (from the early 19th century to the mid-20th century) the steam locomotive was the dominant form of locomotive power. Other sources of power (such as horses, rope or wire, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines) are possible.
The word 'train' comes from the Old French trahiner, itself from the Latin trahere 'pull, draw'.
There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.
