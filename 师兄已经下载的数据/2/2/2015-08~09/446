Chinese Government Gets Sick Of Islamic Violence, and DOES THIS TO 13 Muslim Jihadists… | JEWSNEWS
The Chinese government, getting so sick and tired of Islamic violence, took 13 Muslims and executed all of them in a measure of pure justice.
China executed 13 people today for “terrorist attacks” in the far western region of Xinjiang, state media said, while a further three were sentenced to death for staging a lethal attack in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
“The 13 criminals had planned violent terrorist attacks and ruthlessly killed police officers, government officials and civilians, which took innocent lives, caused huge property losses and seriously endangered public security,” the official news agency Xinhua said.
Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs who speak a Turkic language, and China has blamed previous attacks on Islamist separatists it says seek to establish an independent state there called East Turkestan.
