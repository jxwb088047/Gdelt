Speaking with NPR\'s Steve Inskeep, President Obama argued that the Iran nuclear deal \"cuts off all pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon\" and offers \"an entire infrastructure that\'s built to keep track of what Iran\'s doing.\" About the likelihood that a Republican-controlled Congress will reject the deal, the president said that such a move reflects the opposition of \"a near unanimous portion of Republican representatives\" to \"anything I do.” But he offered that once the agreement is implemented, that opposition will “probably be forgotten.”

This morning President Obama got some good news. Senator Barbara Mikulski announced her support for the Iran deal, which means Republicans will likely be unable to block the deal. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"President Obama scored a major foreign policy victory Wednesday after securing enough votes in the Senate to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, which has come under intense criticism from Republicans and some Democrats.

The agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, struck by international negotiators in Vienna in July, was the subject of an intense lobbying campaign in recent weeks by both the administration and the deal’s opponents in advance of an expected vote as early as next week on a resolution to block the deal’s implementation.”*

Ladies and gentlemen we have a deal! John Kerry has negotiated a deal on behalf of the United States with the Iranians to freeze their nuclear program for ten years. TYT host Cenk Uygur breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. 

\"The deal does this: Iran will give up the bulk of its nuclear program, namely its enriched uranium (nuclear fuel) and its centrifuges (which turn fuel into weapons material). That will leave it with a program way too small to build a bomb.

Iran will also submit to extremely invasive inspections. That\'s to make sure it isn\'t cheating, for example by sneaking nuclear material off to some secret facility and developing a bomb there. The idea is that Iran knows it can\'t get away with cheating, and will be punished if it does, so it won\'t try.

In exchange, the world will remove a lot of the economic sanctions it\'s placed on Iran, and Iran gets to keep just enough of a nuclear program that it can save face.”*

In April 2015, the P5+1, the 5 permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany, negotiated an interim nuclear accord with Iran. Among the key parameters: Iran\'s enrichment capacity, enrichment levels, and stockpile would be limited; its Fordow site converted into a research center; and the Arak heavy water reactor redesigned. In return, the IAEA would gain greater access for inspections, and U.S. and EU sanctions would be lifted. Many in the U.S. fear that a deal as outlined would not go far enough and, instead of being a benefit, would strengthen Iran\'s hand in the Middle East. Not to mention the important question of trust. Is this agreement a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to halt nuclear proliferation, or does President Obama have this wrong?...
