Over the past three days, Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been celebrating Corban Festival, one of the biggest religious occasions in China.
This year's celebration lasts a little bit longer than usual, as Corban lines up with the Mid-Autumn Day, another important Chinese traditional festival for family reunion. Joining us now live from Xinjiang is our reporter Wu Guoxiu.
Q1. So Guoxiu, Corban meets the mid-autumn festival. Tell us about the festival atmosphere there?
