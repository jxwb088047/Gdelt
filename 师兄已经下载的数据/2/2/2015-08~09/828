Cold-Blooded Fox News Demonizes Syrian Refugees
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 13, 2015Leave a Comment
At the same time President Obama is considering raising the number of Syrian refugees we would take into the United States, Fox News is rolling out a network-wide campaign to paint those refugees as potential terrorists. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Wes Clark Jr., hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The political battle lines over this are telling. Ten thousand Syrian refugees is a lot fewer than many congressional Democrats were hoping for; they’d been calling for the US to keep up its reputation as a world leader in resettling refugees by taking in 65,000 Syrians. At the same time, it’s too many for some Republicans, such as Rep. Peter King, who have expressed fear that Syrian refugees will come into the country to commit acts of terrorism.
One problem for the US is that its refugee system simply isn’t built for humanitarian emergencies; it is slow in ways that make it hard for the US to respond to crises like what is unfolding currently in Europe and the Middle East.”*
