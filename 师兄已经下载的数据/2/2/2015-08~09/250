Xinjiang Uygur people lead new way of life thanks to internet - People's Daily Online

 Pataer Keyimu introduces (L) dried grapes to a customer at home in the Grape Valley of Turpan, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Sept. 7, 2015. Compared with life of his grandfather, Pataer leads a new way of life by not only growing and selling grapes, but also tourism and other business thanks to the internet. In 2010, Pataer started a family stay business and sold local products, such as dried grapes, to attract tourists. This year, he estimates that the yearly earnings would reach 150,000 RMB yuan (about 23,505 US dollars). As the 3G service provided by China Telecom covered his hometown in 2010, Pataer opened an online shop to promote his business for nationwide customers. As the harvest season for drying grapes falls recently, Pataer is busy everyday with his smart phone and internet orders. (Xinhua/Zhao Ge)
