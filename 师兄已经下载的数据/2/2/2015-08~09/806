Citizens Make Cop Holster Gun During Arrest
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 25, 2015Leave a Comment
In Boston, a woman wanted for theft was being arrested no a bus when she began to fight back against the officer. The officer quickly drew his gun, but holstered it after several bystanders persuaded him. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A video uploaded to YouTube Friday shows a Boston police officer attempting to arrest a woman on a city bus in Dudley Square. The woman was allegedly under arrest for a petty theft, according to the video’s description.
During the incident, the woman begins to resist the officer’s advance and within seconds the officer recklessly draws his service weapon to use against the unarmed woman on a bus full of passengers. During the altercation, at least four passengers can be seen recording on their cell phones. As the situation progressed, this level of accountability proved extremely valuable.”*
