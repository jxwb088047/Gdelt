One of the big questions weighing on parents' minds each year (and haunting their dreams at night) is just how much they should be pitching in at homework time.

Read my full length post on \'How to Stop Worrying & Stressing\' here:
http://www.bubzbeauty.com/bubbi-likes/485-dont-worry-be-happy.html



In this Girl Talk video, I\'ll be talking about worrying and anxiety. When I realised what worrying was doing to my health and my future, it changed my world and from then on, I was determined to stop worrying and start living. 

I know there are a lot of human stress balls out there. For whatever reason it is, a lot of people just can\'t enjoy life as it is. Now a little stress is normal but stressing too much will affect you and not in a good way.

Most people say they can\'t help if when they worry. Oh! Thing is, you can!

In this video, I will share how you can STOP worrying and stressing. Would you believe me if I told you that I used to be super anxious? NO MORE!

Remember guys- enjoy YOU, enjoy NOW and enjoy LIFE. Only you can give yourself permission and I think you deserve it ^_~

Being disorganized can affect your ability to concentrate and translate to poor grades. Get organized for school and everything will fall into place.

Step 1: Set goals
Set realistic goals for getting organized at the beginning of the school year. Plan to be on time, attend classes faithfully, finish your homework before having fun, and study for exams.

Step 2: Rise earlier

Break study and homework time into small, manageable units with built-in periods of rest. Stick to a schedule that allows for...

Schoolwork is work assigned by a teacher, school, or other educational institution. The term generally refers to both work completed at home (homework), as well as work completed during class (classwork). Typically, schoolwork is done in class, during the time period allotted by the instructor. However, it may be reassigned as homework, in which case it is done outside of the class.
In fact, schoolwork is very similar to homework. It is usually up to the teacher's discretion when assignments are to be completed, and often work that is not finished during class will be assigned as extra homework.
By a broad definition, schoolwork can be extended to refer to any academic activities at school, and would therefore include exams, tests, and quizzes as well as the normal type of work.
Unlike schoolwork, coursework generally refers to the more advanced work done in college. Coursework is the assignments that are assigned by the professor and many require anything from reading to completing projects.
