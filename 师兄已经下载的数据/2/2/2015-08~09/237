Fourteen Cops Vs. A One-Legged Homeless Man
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiAugust 19, 2015Leave a Comment
Fourteen police in San Francisco subdued a homeless man, stepping on his prosthetic leg to pin him down. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Video of the incident begins with the homeless man hidden under a pile of police officers. As the man struggles, it becomes clear that he is wearing a prosthetic leg.
“It is often twisted and backwards in the video,” LaBouvier noted. “An officer can be seen at the 5 second time-mark stomping on the man’s prosthetic leg. In further efforts to subdue a man already on the ground with four people on top of him, they stood on his leg, held it, and twisted it around even after they had cuffed him and pinned him to the piss-stained concrete.”
“These incidents are so quotidian, so mundane, that they do not merit a mention in even passing on the local news. Which is to say, this is everyday harassment,” she lamented. “Yes, it’s racial profiling. Yes, it’s racism. Yes, it’s inequality. This is an American heritage.””*
