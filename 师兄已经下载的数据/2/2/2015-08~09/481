Speaking with NPR\'s Steve Inskeep, President Obama argued that the Iran nuclear deal \"cuts off all pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon\" and offers \"an entire infrastructure that\'s built to keep track of what Iran\'s doing.\" About the likelihood that a Republican-controlled Congress will reject the deal, the president said that such a move reflects the opposition of \"a near unanimous portion of Republican representatives\" to \"anything I do.” But he offered that once the agreement is implemented, that opposition will “probably be forgotten.”

This morning President Obama got some good news. Senator Barbara Mikulski announced her support for the Iran deal, which means Republicans will likely be unable to block the deal. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"President Obama scored a major foreign policy victory Wednesday after securing enough votes in the Senate to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, which has come under intense criticism from Republicans and some Democrats.

The agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, struck by international negotiators in Vienna in July, was the subject of an intense lobbying campaign in recent weeks by both the administration and the deal’s opponents in advance of an expected vote as early as next week on a resolution to block the deal’s implementation.”*

In an interview with NPR’s Steve Inskeep, President Obama defended a nuclear deal with Iran, calling it “the right thing to do for the United States” and for “world peace.” Obama argued that it would succeed whether Iran’s government reforms itself or not. He defended it even though the details have yet to be agreed upon. And he pushed back on critics, saying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was making a “fundamental misjudgment,” and advising presidential contender Scott Walker to take “some time to bone up on foreign policy.”
