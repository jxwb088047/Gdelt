Xinjiang to streamline passport application process- China.org.cn
The government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has decided to streamline the application process for local citizens looking to obtain a passport.
The decision is meant to satisfy the demand among all ethnic groups for easier border crossings.
The police department in Xinjiang will now follow a simplified process. Those who apply the passports for private affairs should hand in paperwork concerning their household registration, identity card, and other necessary documents.
Different documents are demanded according to the purpose for traveling outside of China, such as tourism, visiting relatives, business tours, or study.
Previously, people living in different sub-regions in Xinjiang needed to meet different requirements when they wanted to apply for a passport.
