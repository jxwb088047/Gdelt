ISTANBUL, TURKEY — At least eight were killed and dozens more injured during a wave of attacks across Turkey on Monday that included shots being fired at the US Consulate in Istanbul and a car bomb attack on a police station in the capital.

The US Consulate in Istanbul came under attack Monday when two women reportedly opened fire at the building before being engaged by police.

One of the attackers was chased by police and shot and arrested. She was later reported to be a member of an anti-US organisation known as the Revolutionary People\'s Liberation Army-Front. 

In an earlier attack on the other side of the city, a car bomb was detonated outside a police station during an attack that left one police officer dead and 10 people wounded.

The attacks came as 6 US F-16 fighter jets arrived at Incirlik Air base in southern Turkey to join the air campaign against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.

Another attack saw four police officers killed by a roadside bomb in the southeastern town of Silopi.

Police have detained a female suspect following an attack on the U.S. consulate building in Istanbul on August 10. Two attackers opened fire on the U.S. consulate building in Turkey\'s biggest city, and fled when police shot back. Local media said those involved in the attack on the building included one man and one woman. Turkey has been in a heightened state of alert since it launched what officials described as a \"synchronised war on terror\" last month, including air strikes against Islamic State fighters in Syria and Kurdish militants in northern Iraq. 
U.S. diplomatic missions have been targeted in Turkey in the past.
