US President Barack Obama has asked federal agencies to prepare to receive at least ten thousand Syrian 
refugees over a 12-month period from October first.

The figure is more than six times higher than the 1,500 Syrians who have been given the go-ahead to settle in the US in the four years since the civil war started.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest made the announcement:

In a speech delivered today on the Senate floor, U.S. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said that our country has a responsibility to do our part to address the Syrian refugee crisis—the largest of its kind since World War II.

“As we remember the victims of the attacks in Paris, we cannot forget about all those who are fleeing the terror in Syria. The ongoing conflict in that country has created 4 million refugees,” said Sen. Franken in an excerpt from his speech as prepared for delivery. “There should always be a place in this country for men, women, and children who are fleeing horror - the same kind of horror that befell so many innocent people in Paris last week. This is not the time to score political points. This is the time when we come together and show leadership. This is the time when we uphold the values of our nation.”...

Here in the United States our reactions to terrorism are oftentimes unfortunate. Several states are closing themselves to Syrian refugees out of fear of ISIS. The sad thing is that ISIS is the very group the refugees are fleeing. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"As of Monday afternoon, 23 governors had issued statements saying they would barSyrian refugees from settling in their states, citing fears that violent extremists will masquerade as refugees in order to gain entry to the United States.

Legally, these proclamations have little effect; states don\'t have the authority to bar refugees from settling within their borders. But that hasn\'t stopped governors from issuing statements. The growing list of states that will not accept Syrian refugees currently includes Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Twenty-two of those states are led by Republican governors. Just one, New Hampshire, has a Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan.”*
