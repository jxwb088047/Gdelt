Look: Copycat version of Arc de Triomphe built in Zhengzhou: Shanghaiist
China has gone and built itself another knockoff of the Arc de Triomphe, this time in Zhengzhou, Henan province.
Most everyone is familiar with the world famous triumphal arc which stands in the center of Paris' Place Charles de Gaulle. China is really familiar with it, because it now has a few of its own, including a replica in Jiangsu's Huaxi Village, one in Shenyang and another in Zhejiang's largely abandoned 'little Paris', which features other imitation tourist sites such as the Champ de Mars and the Eiffel Tower.
Now, Zhengzhou has rolled out its own version of the architectural marvel. The 20-meter-tall structure was recently photographed in a less-than-bustling square located near a city market and bears an undeniable resemblance to the original in Paris, as China News points out.
China's flagrant plagiarism of world landmarks is well documented. Recently, the artist behind Chicago's famous 'Bean' sculpture threatened to take legal action against the unnamed creator of a lookalike version in Xinjiang that recently made headlines.
