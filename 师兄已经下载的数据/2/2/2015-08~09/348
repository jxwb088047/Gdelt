Donald Trump was having a press conference in Iowa when journalist Jorge Ramos began asking questions about his immigration policy. Donald didn’t want to answer those questions, so he gestured for security to eject Ramos from the room. In the aftermath of the event, many journalists friendly to the establishment criticized Ramos for not being deferent to Trump. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. 

\"Jorge Ramos, the influential anchor of Univision and an American immigrant from Mexico, has been denouncing Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Yesterday at a Trump press conference in Iowa, Ramos stood and questioned Trump on his immigration views. Trump at first ignored him, then scolded him for speaking without being called on and repeatedly ordered him to “sit down,” then told him: “Go back to Univision.” When Ramos refused to sit down and shut up as ordered, a Trump bodyguard physically removed him from the room. After the press conference concluded, Ramos returned and again questioned Trump about immigration, with the two mostly talking over each other as Ramos asked Trump about the fundamental flaws in his policy. Afterward, Ramossaid: “This is personal. … He’s talking about our parents, our friends, our kids and our babies.””*

At a news conference in Iowa today Donald Trump kicked out Latino journalist, Jorge Ramos, after the journalist asked him about his immigration plans, saying, “You cannot deport 11 million people…” It\'s obviously an important question—and understandable one from Ramos\' standpoint—since Trump\'s the guy who made these ignorant comments two months ago:

\"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems [with them]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”
He\'s also the guy who described two Trump supporters/all-around shitty people who beat up and peed on a Hispanic homeless man, as “very passionate.”

Trump dismissed the prominent Mexican American journalist, an anchor for Univision who’s interviewed President Barack Obama, as well as former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Trump told Ramos to “sit down” because he was never called on, and as a final “jab,” told him to “go back to Univision,” the network that dumped Trump and refused to air the Miss Universe pageant after his atrocious racist comments.
