Turkish Govt. Thinks Vice Reporters Are ISIS
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 2, 2015Leave a Comment
Authorities in the United States are asking for Turkey to release two Vice journalists who have been imprisoned on unfounded allegations that they were working with ISIS and Kurdish militants. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian (The Point), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s presidency, Turkish journalists have increasingly been badgered, intimidated, threatened, and punished. Now, however, the Turkish government is going after two foreign journalists.
Britons Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, working for Vice News, were originally detained in southeast Turkey, along with a translator and a driver, for not having proper identification. But now they’re being accused of “engaging in terror activity” and having connections to ISIS.”*
