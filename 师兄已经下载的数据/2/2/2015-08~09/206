Xinjiang is known for its colorful landscape and diverse culture. The old town of Kashgar for example, stands out for its history of more than 2,000 years.
Since 2010, a renovation project at a cost of 7 billion yuan has helped to transform the crumbling houses and render them earthquake-proof, while keeping the traditional features. renovated town.After morning prayers, the old teahouse that sits in the heart of Kashgar’s old town gets packed. There’s no better way to start the day for Uyghurs than washing down some freshly baked naan with black tea, while drifting to the melody and rhythm of Muqam. The teahouse happens to be the set for Hollywood's blockbuster "The kite runner". And it’s stood as a witness to change."It is a place in the old town where everyone knows everyone. For more than one hundred years, the teahouse has witnessed changes in both the face of this neighborhood as well as in the lives of people. And after the renovation, you can still find the iconic elements of Uyghur architecture across the old town," said Muhammad Usman, Kashgar Teahouse owner. Today, what is referred to as the old town of Kashgar is a maze of winding cobblestone streets leading past dozens of small mosques and shops; around every corner, we were greeted by children with a playful curiosity.The heart of Uyghur culture - the old town of Kashgar is a Silk Road oasis on the western edge of Xinjiang. Since 2010, more than 20,000 old and dilapidated houses have been renovated to ensure people's safety, the massive project was carried out under the principle of preserving its cultural relics.To find out how the buildings here got their new look but stayed true to Uyghur culture, I’ve come to see Muhammad Karim. His house, an intriguing mixture of old and new is decorated in traditional Uygur style while featuring all the modern comforts, even a solar powered boiler."Before the renovation, very often we had electricity black-outs and water shortages. Cooking was done at the fireplace since there was no natural gas supply. Now these are the last things we worry about," said Muhammad Karim, Kashgar resident.Muhammad's story is shared by the other 220,000 residents living in Kashgar old town. The renovation project adhered strictly to national conservation standards for historical cities. And in particular, renovators respected the resident’s wishes, and piece by piece redecorated to preserve the original look."Some people in the neighborhood were concerned about whether the renovation project would destroy the unique Ugygur features... so while reinforcing the houses, distinctive architectural forms and features were also well preserved. To me, my house looks just like before, only it provides more comforts for living," Karim said.
Some might ask: if these houses made of mud and grass have stood the test of the time for the past 2,000 years, why are we altering them now? Perhaps, the better question to ask is: If there isn't any renovation or reinforcement, how can such vibrant, living city on the silk road stand firm to open a new chapter in its long history.
