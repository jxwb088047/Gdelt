Who are Uighurs? A look at group from restive China regionBEIJING (AP) — Arrests made and details revealed about the Aug. 17 Bangkok bombing that killed 20 people have raised the question of whether members of an ethnic and religious minority from China's far west were involved. A primer on the Uighurs, the repression they face in China and their presence abroad:
___
WHO ARE THE UIGHURS?
The Uighurs (pronounced WEE-gurs) are a Turkic-speaking Muslim ethnic group native to China's far western region of Xinjiang, which was sporadically controlled by Chinese dynasties over the centuries. They have long complained of ethnic discrimination and religious restriction under the Chinese government, which is dominated by members of the Han ethnic group. Several decades of economic development have brought an influx of Han people into the Uighurs' oil-rich home region. Uighurs have felt marginalized in the region's economic boom, sparking ethnic tensions that erupted in the late 1990s and then again about a decade later, culminating in rioting that left nearly 200 dead in the regional capital of Urumqi in 2009.

RECENT UNREST
Since 2009, there have been frequent attacks on police stations, military checkpoints and government buildings in Xinjiang. The violence has spilled into other regions with Uighur militants accused of mounting attacks in train stations, markets and even a public square in Beijing. In March 2014, a group of Uighurs — including two women — slashed indiscriminately at crowds at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming, killing 31. In May of 2014, a bomb assault on a market in Urumqi left 43 people dead.

BEIJING'S RESPONSE
Beijing has long been wary of independence-minded militants in Xinjiang and has kept tight controls over the region. Beijing began labeling the militants terrorists in 2001 in a bid to win international support for the struggle against the militants. Scholars have argued that China's stifling policies in the region — including restrictions on beards and veils — have marginalized the Uighurs and fueled militancy. Last year, well-known Uighur economist Ilham Tohti, who had urged Beijing to review its policies in Xinjiang to foster reconciliation, was convicted of inciting separatism and sentenced to life in prison. In response to the 2014 attacks, Beijing launched a one-year crackdown on terror cells in Xinjiang, executing and jailing hundreds of people on terrorism-related charges.

FLEEING CHINA
Uighurs have been fleeing China in recent years, often by way of Southeast Asia. Rights advocates say they are escaping repressive rule, but Beijing says many are leaving to join jihad with the intention of returning to China to carry out terrorist attacks. Courts in Xinjiang cities of Hotan, Kashgar and Karamay recently jailed Chinese smugglers who helped Uighurs cross illegally into Vietnam, as well as several Uighurs who unsuccessfully tried to emigrate illegally. While there are large Uighur diasporas in Europe and the United States, Turkey is the destination of choice for most seeking to leave China. Turkey's government is under intense public pressure to support the Uighurs, leading to tensions in Ankara's relationship with Beijing.

THAILAND'S REPATRIATION
In late 2014, the Thai government detained hundreds of migrants believed to be Uighurs in refugee camps, including women and children. Many refused to speak to Chinese officials, claiming to be Turkish, and many obtained legitimate Turkish passports and later settled in Turkey. However, on July 9 of this year, Thailand repatriated more than 100 of the Uighurs — mostly men — who were wanted by China as terror suspects. This drew criticism from Uighur advocates, human rights groups, the U.S., the United Nations and others, all concerned that the returnees would be persecuted. Video footage by Chinese state media showed the men hooded and under tight security. Chinese authorities have granted no independent access to any court proceedings for the returnees, allowing the government to control the narrative about them.

BOMBING CASE
Though there have been many theories about perpetrator and motive, speculation about a Uighur connection to the Bangkok bombing came almost immediately, in part because the bomb went off at a shrine popular with Chinese tourists.
Police have arrested two foreigners, confiscated bomb-making materials from two apartments on the outskirts of Bangkok and are looking for 10 other suspects. The first suspect arrested was found at one of the apartments and possessed a fake Turkish passport. The second, arrested near the Thai-Cambodia border, carried a passport that indicated he was from Xinjiang. Police say they believe the bomber has left the country.
Authorities have intentionally avoided calling the bombing an act of terrorism for fear of hurting Thailand's reputation.
I'll be honest and say that in my ignorance, I didn't even know how to pronounce "Uighur" before I read that.
You may also want to send this story onto the RTP because they seem not to have a frickin clue who they are or what they are about!

They seem to have missed the point that the Bangkok bombers were in preparation long before those people were deported.
A very inconvenient truth which people appear to be ignoring.

They are pronounced as "Wiggers" You know farang who want to act black.
Thailand does not have any reputation left to speak of and is only concerned
A Thai relative arrived back in Bangkok thru Swampy and was amazed that most

And here we go again. Do you have any proof that the Thai immigration got bribed by 50000 people from Xinjiang.
If ISIL was behind the bombing they would have announced it already from Day 1. Their is no need to take the bribe as the borders are easy to penetrate in Thailand. Lets assume they paid a bribe it would also mean that either Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar too got bribed.
If ISIL got 50,000 potential terrorists here in Thailand they would send them to the South or off to Malaysia but certainly not Syria or Iraq.
The CIA estimate that their are 31,000 ISLIL members (fighters) and ISIL claims their are 100,000. According to your numbers their must be 51,000 ISIL members from the PRC (Xinjiang) and around 49,000 Arabs, Caucasians, Africans etc. Can you provide any website to your numbers?
It is well known that Thailand is/was a hub for illegal immigrants from China, Bangadesh, Pakistan, India etc to continue their trip to a 3rd country but please don't put every PRC citizen from Xinjiang on the list as a terrorist. Many of those from Xinjiang move on to Malaysia and that's why most of the time move via Southern Thailand.
Its easier for anyone from Xinjiang to travel to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and then resettle to Turkey. Their is no need to come to Southeast Asia.
Why would ISIL use Thailand as a transit point when they can just enter from Central Asia into Iran and then they are in Iraq directly.
Going back to history: The first translation of the  Chinese Buddhist Canon in a "western language" was made by the Uighurs.
The Uighur language is a turc language with a grammar similar to Pali and Sanskrit.
Information from my son, he translated only seven pages of the Chinese Canon. (only 20 to 30% are translated in a western language.)

Interesting piece.

ISIL was running a smuggling ring. They wouldn't have wanted to bomb Bangkok and expose their operation, except for Prayuth's deportation order.
Doesn't make sense. If 100 PRC citizens from China were deported why would they put a bomb (ISIL) if they still have hundreds or even thousands more here in Thailand.
I doubt ISLIl was running the smuggling ring but would say it was Bangla's and Pakistani's in collaboration with the Thai's (Thai Army, Immigration and the Border Control Police). China sure has to say that those peoples that were deported from Thailand back to China were terrorists but the International community didn't bought that story.
I am sure from Day 1 that terrorists from Xinjiang were involved but certainly not ISIL. If ISIL is involved their would be multiply suicide bombings all over Bangkok and not one lone bombing at the Erawan shrine but they would have targeted Khaosan Road to hit as much Israelis as they can, a bomb at Nana Plaza or Soi Cowboy or even soft targets such as Central World or King Power which is visited by thousands of Chinese every day. The Sofitel next to King Power is 95% booked by Chinese
I am sure it was terrorists linked to the Uyghur's that did the bombing but not ISIL. Its just 3 1/2 hours for Uighur to cross from Xinjiang to Kazakhstan so why woud they make a journey of almost 6000 kms or a 5 - 6 day trip to Bangkok.
It doesn't make sense to take the risk as Kazakhstan is happy to take them on board.
They seem to have missed the point that the Bangkok bombers were in preparation long before those people were deported.
A very inconvenient truth which people appear to be ignoring.
What the govt. did in regard to the repatriation of the Uighurs to China was a travesty at best and an act of absolute cowardice at worst. It was an abomination. It invited blowback and condemnation.
Exactly, I don't think the bomb attack was planned b4 the deportation I think agroup of highly peeved uighurs decided on this and the smuggling ring was caught up in the aftermath.
The amount of Thai border corruption is huge as is the corruption in China from the other end of the smuggling ring.
If Uighurs prefer Turkey as a place to stay then it is easy for them to be recruited to syria and fight for ISIS for good money, Turkey seems to turn a blind eye to who crosses into Syria and allow stolen ISIS oil into Turkey to be sold on the black market, hence funding ISIS.
Isis connections would probably not have wanted a bomb attack to screw up the smuggling ring-- theory only.
The Uighurs that were deported had hoods tied over their heads and rumours are some were shot in Thailand and many of them executed on returning to China.
Given the amount of attacks and murders/ bombings Uighurs have committed in China this is part of the way they operate now.

Go back a few hundred years. They were a Mongol tribe who showed Genghis how to cross the Gobi to attack China. They were forced to convert to islam by conquest.
China's suppression of the Uighurs seems very similar to Thailand's vigorous suppression of the Malay-Thais in the South. This was a common ground between Thaksin and the Thai military.
The detrimental social and economic reaction to the Shrine bombing has shown such as act can be a political force multipler. If the Malay-Thai insurgents find little or no hope of a meaningful resolution of their conflict with the Junta by year-end, there would be a temptation for them to use similar tactics of larger proportion beyond the Southern boundary. 
Prayut needs to be careful when he circles the wagons of nationalism to protect the nation. He may find himself in a Zulu-style standoff.

I completely agree with your speculation. It is a weighted speculation I consider to be supported by the known facts.
"Beijing began labeling the militants terrorists in 2001 in a bid to win international support for the struggle against the militants. Scholars have argued that China's stifling policies in the region — including restrictions on beards and veils — have marginalized the Uighurs and fueled militancy.

"Chinese authorities have granted no independent access to any court proceedings for the returnees, allowing the government to control the narrative about them."
Really, we are only getting one side of the story. Apply the terrorist label. Allow no intervention or observation....voila, bad guys.
USA and other countries have done it, so why not China?
Maybe they are bad guys...but we have to be honest and admit that we do not know the other side of the story.
