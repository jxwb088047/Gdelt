Thailand Issues Arrest Warrant for 'Uighur' Attack Mastermind
Thai authorities today said an arrest warrant has been issued for an ethnic "Uighur" man, the alleged mastermind behind the country's worst terror attack that killed 20 people here.
The man was identified as Abdusataar Abdulrehman and he was charged with illegal possession of military hardware.
"He is Uighur according to his passport," national police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri said.
Thai authorities have arrested two suspects in connection with the twin bombings last month.
One of them, Mieraili Yusufu, identified the alleged mastermind as Abdulrahman, also known by the aliases Abdusataar and Izan. Izan left Thailand on a Bangladesh-bound flight on August 16, a day before the bombing.
Thailand's deportation of 109 Uighur refugees to China in July had also triggered protests in Turkey.
Thai officials believe Izan left Bangkok for Bangladesh and from there to China.
Two bomb blasts rocked Bangkok last month. One of them targeted the Erawan Brahma Shrine on August 17, killing 20 people and injuring more than 100 others.

Recently army personnel were employed in building a pontoon bridge on the Yamuna in Delhi for an event of Sri Sri Ravishankar's Art of Living which will feature yoga and meditation sessions, peace prayers and traditional cultural performances from around the world. As the involvement of the army in the organisation of a personal event has drawn much flak, defence ministry sources have justified the move. They argue it is not the first time that the army has been engaged in building bridges for an event, and that it regularly built pontoon bridges during the Kumbh Mela.
