“It’s a very simple idea. Greece is suffering from a lot of financial problems, they have dozens of deserted islands. Italy has the problem too. And already the Syrian refugees are in Greece and are in Italy.”

The island would be undeveloped, and, like a city building simulation game, sprout up from scratch to serve as a temporary shelter for the refugees, “So it’s a very simple solutions.

Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris said he has identified two Greek islands that could be used to host Syrian refugees, and suggested setting up a joint-stock company to deal with the expected donations.
Sawiris, the chairman of Orascom Telecom Media and Technology Holding, has been in contact with the owners of the islands in hopes of moving ahead with the plan, according to a statement from his media office posted on his Facebook page late Monday. Sawiris said the talks would depend on whether the owners can secure approval from the Greek government.
The Egyptian billionaire had announced that he was interested in buying an island where refugees could be housed until they can return to their own country. In a Sept. 8 Bloomberg TV interview, Sawiris said the proposal was something motivated by a desire “to clear my conscience as a human being, and nothing more.”
The best way to deal with donations would be to set up a joint-stock company with a capital of $100 million, Sawiris said in his Facebook statement. Such a step would ensure that any money invested “will not be completely lost, as the asset (the island) will remain.”

Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris wants to buy an island off the coast of Italy or Greece to house among the hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing the Mediterranean at the risk of their own lives. \"Greece or Italy, sell me an island, I declare it independent, get there the refugees and allow them to participate in building their new country,\" as tweeted wealthy businessman. \"And that\'s really feasible,\" he said today at the French news agency AFP. \"There are dozens of islands that leave hundreds of thousands of refugees can receive.\" Since early this year, more than 350,000 people fleeing poverty or conflict in their country of origin and have crossed the Mediterranean in the hope of a better life in Europe. More than 2,600 of them do not survive the adventure. Sawiris confirmed by an Egyptian private television that he will contact the Italian and Greek governments to concretize his idea. In Greece, which holds a forced sale of state assets, this should pose few problems.

He estimates its cost at between \"10 and 100 million dollars\", but thinks that the \"main issue is the investment in infrastructure\" will be. \"There will be temporary stays to accommodate people and then you give them work in the construction of homes, schools, universities and hospitals.\" \"But if the situation improves in their own country, the person who wants to return, according to the businessman, whose family in Egypt, the popular artificial resort of El Gouna has developed on the shores of the Red Sea.

Earlier this week, Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris tweeted out an idea he called “crazy.” He would buy an island, fill it with refugees, and then provide jobs and housing until they could return to their homeland—if they so chose. “Greece or Italy sell me an island, ill call its independence and host the migrants and provide jobs for them building their new country,” he wrote on Twitter. Then, added: “Crazy idea .. Maybe but at least temporary until they can return to their countries ?? !!”

Naguib Onsi Sawiris (or Sawires, Egyptian Arabic: نجيب انسى ساويرس, IPA: [næˈɡiːb ˈʔonsi sæˈwiːɾɪs] or [sæˈwiːɾes]; born June 15, 1954) is an Egyptian businessman and politician. He was executive chairman of the telecommunications companies Wind Telecom and Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH) before turning to politics in May 2011. OTH launched the first mobile operator in Egypt, Mobinil in 1998.
OTH has 20,000 employees and manages 11 GSM operators around the globe. In the beginning, OTH’s strategy was to target underpenetrated high population markets. However, soon after it started to pursue more developed markets with the launch of Wind Mobile by its Globalive subsidiary in Canada in December 2009. Moreover, OTH launched the first mobile operator in North Korea in 2008, “Koryolink”.
Sawiris joined Orascom in 1979. The Orascom Group is the country’s largest private sector employer and has the largest market capitalization on the Cairo & Alexandria Stock Exchange. Sawiris established and built the railway, information technology, and telecommunications sectors of Orascom. The conglomerate was later split into separate operating companies: Orascom Telecom (OT), Orascom Construction Industries (OCI), Orascom Hotels & Development and Orascom Technology Systems (OTS). OTH was established in late 1997 and since then has been chaired by Sawiris.
