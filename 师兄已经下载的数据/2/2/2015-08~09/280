Police in Thailand say bombing suspect has fled to Turkey - SFGate
BANGKOK — A key suspect in last month’s bombing at a Bangkok shrine that killed 20 people has fled to Turkey, Thai police said Monday, in another indication that the attack could be the work of members of China’s ethnic Uighur minority who have sympathizers in Turkey.
A senior Turkish government official, however, denied that the man had escaped to the country.
“There is no record of the suspect having entered Turkey,” the official said in an e-mail on condition of anonymity. “Nor have the Thai authorities informed us that a terrorism suspect was traveling to Turkey.”
Thai police had previously said the man, carrying a Chinese passport in the name Abudureheman Abudusataer, may have directed the Aug. 17 bombing of the Erawan Shrine. Investigations revealed that he left Thailand on Aug. 16 for Bangladesh, and police speculated that he might have gone to China.
National police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri, however, said information gathered by Thai police and Bangladeshi officials showed the man departed Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, on Aug. 30 and traveled to Istanbul in Turkey as his final destination.
This bolstered the theory that those behind the blast are Uighurs from the Chinese region of Xinjiang who have close ties to Turkey. Several of the 12 bombing suspects for whom arrest warrants have been issued are believed to be Turkish.
Some speculate they may be separatists or Islamist extremists angry that Thailand repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China in July. Uighurs complain of oppression by the Chinese government.
