In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 13, 2015Leave a Comment
Today both regular Americans and politicians are remembering 9/11 in various ways. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Wes Clark Jr., hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“President Barack Obama marked the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., Friday morning.
According to a White House pool report, Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and 200 White House staffers gathered and reflected at 8:46 a.m., the same time that an airplane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001.”*
