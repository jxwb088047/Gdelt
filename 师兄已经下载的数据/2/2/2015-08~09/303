BANGKOK: -- Royal Thai Police commissioner Pol Gen Somyot Poompunmuong said that the motive of the deadly bomb attack at Ratchaprasong as a personal revenge, ruling out a possibility of international terrorism.
He said from the questioning of the foreign bomb suspect, the motive of the bombing was to take revenge for his friends and relatives who were deported by Thai authorities recently.
Pol Gen Somyot did not specify exactly if the attack was stemmed from the recent deportation of over 100 Uighurs, a Turkish Muslim minority group, back to China but said the bomber was angry with the deportation and then took avenge.
He also said the bomb suspect has several fake passports and each passport carries a different name.
He said the police have sent the suspect to the military for detention and further questioning.
The suspect was given a bullet proof jacket and helmet to wear for security reason while being escorted in heavily guarded convoy to the First Army Division of the Royal Guards in Dusit district.
Earlier in the afternoon, the combined force of over 100 police and soldiers searched Rooms 404, 409, 410, 411, 412 on the fourth floor of an apartment on Soi Chuemsamphan in Nong Chok district rented by Ahemet Mehmmet Emin Ayse following tipoff that he might be involved in the bombing.
The man rented the rooms since January 27 last year.
Found in the search included a shirt tainted with explosive substances, ball bearings in plastic packages, several sizes of square and round batteries, electrical cords, electric welder, adhesive tapes, screw driver, scissor, a plastic tank with chemicals, box of sodium carbonate, several sizes of metal pipes with covers, sticky tape and ignition fuses.
But it was not yet known if the name of the man who rented the rooms is the same as the bomb suspect.
However the national police chief indicated that the suspect has been in the country for years.
Who just happened to know where to get 3KG's of explosive?

Sending those Uighers back seems to be a wise move after all. Who knows how many more trained bomb makers might have been among that crowd.

Without raising any suspicion? I would be expecting this guy to be singing like a canary, he's going to hang, has nothing to lose, so suppliers of explosive on the open market better start booking holidays as the BIB are coming for you!!

Renting 4 apts since jan, but the incidents happened in July..
I still can't really believe it but if this is HIM then        
Seems he's far to careless or downright stupid or downright unfortunate, he could have been out of the country in hours, certainly days..whys he still here.. maybe into people smuggling but that's not bombing
So in the space of 2-3 months since his friends were deported back to Turkey, he and his colleagues locates a source for explosives, source materials and the know how/knowledge and begins assembling "complicated special devices", and recce and plan target locations and finally initiates one at the Erawan shrine?  and he's only doing this as his motive is personal ? he's not really an International Terrorist? That level of planning isn't done by someone pissed off, that's done by people in the know. 
This shows the Thai juntas foreign policies is as disastrous as many already predicted. This present government do not have their hand on the stick.

The 1951 Refugee Convention spells out that a refugee is someone who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country."
No one did anything directly to him, and he attacked innocent 3rd parties.  The very antithesis of personal.
I think the reason he is still in Thailand is that he rented the room since last year , so he was actually living in Thailand , probably got money sent to him, then he met up with his friends and planned the operation. So he would have had time to buy the bomb materials . So there was no need for him to escape the kingdom like the others , he just hoped that nobody would recognize him .
