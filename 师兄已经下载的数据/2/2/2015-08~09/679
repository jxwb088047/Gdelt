A Taste Of China: Xinjiang Kebabs | News World India
Want to savour the famous kebabs from China’s Xinjiang region? Here’s a chance for Delhiites to try Xinjiang’s mouth-watering chicken and lamb kebabs and other varieties at
an ongoing festival here.
The Chinese herbs and spices used in these kebabs give a distinct flavour and taste. Xinjiang is home to many ethnic minority groups, including Turks and Uyghurs, who have popularised kebabs. The Uyghurs have popularised their unique style of barbecued lamb ‘kawaps’ throughout China.
“We wanted to do something unique and give food connoisseurs an opportunity to try these Chinese kebabs,” says Saurabh Joshi, Manager at Hotel Ashok’s Pan Asian restaurant Nom Nom, where the Chinese Kebab Festival is on till August 9.
