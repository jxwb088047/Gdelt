Calls For #BlackLivesMatter To Double Down On Fox News | Crooks and Liars
I doubt anyone from #BlackLivesMatter is about to be intimidated by Bill O’Reilly’s threat to put them “out of business.” Nevertheless, The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur urges the group to double down in response.
In the video above, TYT’s Uygur and Ana Kasparian blast Fox’s disingenuousness and hypocrisy by trying to blame #BlackLivesMatter for some recent police murders. TYT makes a point I’ve previously made: that nobody on Fox has any business accusing anyone else of causing a murder, especially given O’Reilly’s inflammatory rhetoric toward Dr. George Tiller, who was assassinated after years of O’Reilly calling him “Dr. Tiller the baby killer.”
Not mentioned are some of my other points, that Fox’s championing of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s armed insurrection against law enforcers should disqualify them from condemning some stray group of #BlackLivesMatter protesters chanting something hateful about cops. Especially given that one of Bundy’s actual supporters actually murdered two Las Vegas police officers. Nor the point that FoxNews.com regularly allows commenters to talk about murdering liberals and other people they don’t like.
But Uygur and Kasparian are spot on. Especially in the conclusion that protesting is “the most American thing” for #BlackLivesMatter to do. “If Fox doesn’t like it, they should do twice as many protests,” Uygur says.
I’ll add that I’d love to see them protest at Fox News. Considering their terror of angry black people, each protest would have twice the impact!

We watch Fox so you don't have to!
Watch the full video before you judge. Remember what the Center for Medical Progress "filmed?
"But no one loves number one and number two like me! You know what the greatest thing about me is? I love the spirit of the number one and number two! The good ones and twos, not the bad ones, those are some bad dudes. They're killing us at the border.
I love the number twos. I've hired thousands and thousands of number ones and twos. They've got great spirit. No one loves them more than me.
You also know who is a tough cookie. Number three, number three is a tough cookie."
In looking at Bernie's speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, how long will it be before we see pundits attacking him as anti-semitic?
