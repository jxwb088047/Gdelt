BEIJING: Police in the southwestern Chinese border province of Yunnan have shot dead four militants and found 553 people attempting to flee the country since 2014, state media said on Friday, giving details of efforts to stop Uighurs from leaving China.
In a detailed report of foiled attempts to leave the country, Yunnan police said that they had mounted a ‘swift and fierce attack’ and “shot dead four violent terrorists,” China News Service said.
In one incident in March, Chinese police on the Vietnamese border shot dead a suspect “madly holding a knife to attack police,” the report said. A second suspect from the same group was killed the next month.
The account did not mention the ethnicity of the suspects, but the language used is typical of how China talks about what it says are Uighur extremists.
Scores of Uighurs keen to escape unrest in China's Xinjiang region have travelled clandestinely to Turkey
The attack occurred at the beginning of the fasting month of Ramazan on Monday
