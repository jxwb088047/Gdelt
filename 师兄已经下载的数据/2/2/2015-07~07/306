China protests US condemnation of Uighur deportations | World News
BEIJING – China’s Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the United States for its condemnation of the deportation of a group of Uighurs from Thailand last week, as state television showed pictures of some being returned with hoods on their heads.
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs keen to escape unrest in China’s western Xinjiang region, have travelled clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey.
China is home to about 20 million Muslims spread across its vast territory, only a portion of whom are Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language.
