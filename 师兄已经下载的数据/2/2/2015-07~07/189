Thailand to send team to China to check on deported Uighurs - Asia - Around the globe - World - Dalje.com
Thailand's military government will send a team of observers to check on the status of Uighur refugees it deported to China this week, a report said Friday.
The move comes after worldwide condemnation of the junta's decision to repatriate some 100 Uighur refugees late Wednesday.
The government will also invite representatives of international organizations to accompany the observer team to China, the Bangkok Post reported.
The Uighurs, previously held in Thai immigration detention centres for illegally entering the country, have been at the centre of a tug of war between China and Turkey, which both claim to be their country of origin.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has said Muslim Uighur arrivals are welcome as "brothers" in Turkey, while Uighurs say they face discrimination and persecution by authorities in China.
The US State Department released a statement early Friday condemning the deportation, saying it "runs counter to Thailand’s international obligations."
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Thursday it was "shocked by this deportation of some 100 people and consider it a flagrant violation of international law” and of previous Thai assurances.
The Thai consulate in Istanbul was attacked late Wednesday by groups protesting the Uighurs' possible deportation to China, the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha hit back at the international criticisms, insisting that "China has gauranteed their safety."
"Why do you people keep dragging Thailand into conflict with Turkey, China or with the Uighurs?" the general said in a televised press conference. "Are we supposed to let them stay and care for them to the third generation?"
