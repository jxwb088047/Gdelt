I have lived my entire 38 years in the South. My Dad's family is from Bell Buckle, Tennessee, and my Mom's family hails from Pulaski, where the Ku Klux Klan was founded. I remember well going to visit my great grandmothers on their farms out in the sticks. I learned early in my life that my roots are in the country, and that I should be proud of my heritage. Later I learned...
(CNN)The racist massacre in a South Carolina church has tipped the balance in a decades-old tug of war over the meaning of the Confederate battle flag. Its champions have argued it's a symbol of Southern culture, the historic flag of the South. Critics say it's a racist symbol that represents a war to uphold slavery and, later, a battle to oppose civil rights advances. We take...
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Country rockers Steve Earle & The Dukes have released a new song exhorting Mississippi to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag. The single, "It's Time, Mississippi," went on sale Friday as a fundraiser for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

A junior at the University of Alabama has launched a petition asking that a building on campus be renamed to honor Harper Lee, the late author, rather than a former senator who was a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. The petition, launched four days ago upon Lee’s quiet passing, has already garnered 2,328 signatures as of this morning. It calls on the university president to erase a...
Pop music is an exceptionally open art form, accommodating of all kinds of ideas, including those that, in different contexts — without a tune or a backbeat — might be laughed off as embarrassing or scorned as tasteless. There’s nothing necessarily ridiculous, therefore, about a plaintive country-rap power ballad in which a...
America's heart is broken because of the heinous racial murders and devastating church burnings in southern states. As a white southern Christian transplanted in New York City, I recognize the sociology of white supremacy leading to these devastating crimes and stand firmly against the actions of the perpetrators.

Mumbai Police commissioner Ajay Bhardwaj announces the end of the \"Mafia Raj\" in the city, in order to try to bring peace to the city\'s streets. However, a ruthless south Indian named Vijay Surya comes to the city, aspiring to be the most powerful Mafia Don there. Staying in Dharavi with his friend, he is introduced to a local politician Laalu, who is in trouble and offers him help. He recruits a portion of the gangsters and criminals living in Mumbai led by Naseer to work under him. Surya\'s henchman Shakeel manages to kill a witness of Laalu\'s crimes in the jail where he is kept in, winning Laalu\'s friendship.

After this, Surya promises to clear the debts of Dharavi locals so that their houses will not be repossessed. His men rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of Bank of Maharashtra and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their savior. Surya is aware of Bhardwaj\'s intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj\'s daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya\'s real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.

Surya is released after manipulating Bhardwaj by having his associates kidnap Chitra. He promises to leave crime behind him and asks Bhardwaj for permission to marry Chitra. When they refuse his proposal, he insists to Bhardwaj that he will set up a business which is ...

The movie opens with an unknown person killing Minister Rawat\'s brother Taxi Set and his henchmen thus saving three men. Rawat orders a CBI Officer to catch the criminal so that he may kill that killer. The scene shifts to Hyderabad where Cherry is a software engineer in CgTrix. He has an uncle named Jilebi, who unexpectedly runs into trouble and angers the local Don Gandi Babji. Cherry hatches a plan to save Jilebi from Babji and succeeds but falls for Babji\'s sister Madhu in the process. Though Madhu initially rejects him, after his act of saving children from a mafia don, she reciprocates his love. This angers Babji and he goes to kill him but gets shocked seeing Cherry assassinating the DGP of West Bengal. As fate would have it, at this point, the CBI Officer finds out that Cherry is responsible for the two murders, who is innocent in reality. With Jilebi, the CBI Officer goes to Kumbha Mela at Kasi to catch him. Meanwhile, when Rawat is offering holy rituals the CBI Officer catches Cherry and holds him. But the look-alike of Cherry, who killed Rawat\'s Brother, rises from the Ganges and hurts Rawat with a trident and injures all of his guards. As he is about to deliver a finishing Blow, the CBI Officer tases him and arrests him, exonerating Cherry. Then Cherry comes to know the story of his look-alike....

South is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography.
South is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. It is the opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west.
By convention, the bottom side of a map is south.
To go south using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 180°.
True south is the direction towards the southern end of the axis about which the earth rotates, called the South Pole. The South Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south geographic pole.
The word south is derived from the name of one of the four dwarves in Norse mythology, Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, who each represented one of the directions of the world. The etymology of South can be traced back to the Old English word suth, related to the Old High German word sund, and perhaps sunne in Old English with sense of "the region of the sun."
