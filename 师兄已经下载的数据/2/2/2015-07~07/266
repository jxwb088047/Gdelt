Turks Declare Uighur Solidarity At Hague China Embassy | Fulton News
– Placing a black wreath in front of the embassy, group shout ‘Murderer China’ and ‘Long Live East Turkestan’

THE HAGUE – A group of Turkish citizens broke their Ramadan fast in front of China’s embassy in the Hague late Tuesday, protesting what they claim is oppression against Muslims in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region.
Placing a black wreath in front of the embassy, the group shouted “Murderer China” and “Long Live East Turkestan.”
Uighur – who constitute around 45 percent of the population of Xinjiang – have accused China of carrying out repressive policies that restrain their religious, commercial and cultural activities.
Speaking for the group, East Turkestan Education Union official Esa Sawut urged China to stop oppression towards Uighur.
Sawut said China has implemented restrictions towards the East Turkestan region and he said protests would continue around the world until Uighur people “have their rights back.”
Many Turkish people refer to Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region as East Turkestan.
“The oppression towards Uighur is not limited to Ramadan,” Sawut said, adding that they chose the embasy to break their fast to show they will “never forget East Turkestan.”
Such protests have been taking place worldwide since a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement expressed “deep concern” to China over media reports that Beijing had instilled a fasting ban on segments of its Uighur Muslim population.
