Under pressure from Turkish nationalist groups who advocate closer links between the Turkic groups, Ankara has been trying for months to convince Thailand and China to allow the group to resettle in Turkey.

Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli later downplayed the latter attack, saying it was difficult to differentiate between Koreans and Chinese since they “both have slanted eyes.
