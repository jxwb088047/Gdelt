Uighur group based in Turkey calls for calm
Free East Turkestan Platform says believes Turkish presidential trip will lead to diplomatic initiatives to secure life and property of Uighur sent to China
A Uighur group based in Turkey has called for calm following recent protests against Beijing’s alleged restrictions on its Muslim Turkic minority and Thailand’s recent deportation of 109 Uighur to China.
The statement follows Turkey-wide anti-China protests amid reports of Beijing imposing a ban on Muslims fasting during Ramadan, while the Thai consulate in Istanbul was attacked last week after Thailand sent Uighur to China amid reports of persecution.
In its statement Tuesday, the Free East Turkestan Platform said Thailand's decision to return the Uighur to China had "caused indignation" in Turkey. 
It then blamed the attack on the Thai diplomatic mission on Uighur “worried about the fate of their kinsmen,” who it said had gathered at the consulate when false reports spread, resulting in “undesirable” incidents.
The group also expressed sadness over what it called “unpleasant actions” against the Turkish police in Ankara.
"We are inviting our East Turkestan citizens, those who have been exposed to years of human rights violations and violence, and those who sought refuge in Turkey, to calm down," it said.
It then called on the Chinese government to "stop violating human rights."
A presidential statement confirmed Tuesday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit China between July 28 and 30.
With this in mind, the Platform said that it believes Erdogan will conduct diplomatic initiatives to protect the lives and property of the Uighur sent to China.
