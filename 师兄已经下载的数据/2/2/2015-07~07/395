Indonesia jails Uygurs for conspiracy with Islamist militants
Three men from China’s Uygur Muslim minority have been jailed six years by a court in Indonesia for conspiring with militant Islamists.
A panel of judges in the north Jakarta district court found Ahmet Mahmud, 20, Abdulbasit Tuzer, 24, and Abdullah, 28, also known as Altinci Bayyram, guilty of violating anti-terrorism and immigration laws, according to AP.
The men were arrested last year while trying to meet Abu Wardah Santoso, Indonesia’s most wanted militant, in Central Sulawesi province.
They plan to appeal the sentence, Reuters reported, citing their lawyer.
A fourth Uygur man who was arrested with them is being tried separately and is due to be sentenced on July 29.
Hundreds of Uygurs trying to escape unrest in Xinjiang have traveled illegally via Southeast Asia to Turkey.
They often end up crossing into Syria and Iraq to fight for Islamic State militants, according to Chinese authorities.
Last week, Thailand deported 109 Uygurs, sparking concerns among human rights groups that they could be mistreated back in China.
