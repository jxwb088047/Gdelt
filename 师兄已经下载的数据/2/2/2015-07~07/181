Same Old Warmongering, Pretty New Face - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 23, 2015Leave a Comment
Tomi Lauren is a wannabe Fox News host trying to make a name for herself. Her new video has gone viral in conservative circles by repeating the same pro-war talking points as every other republican ever. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Tomi Lahren, who hosts “On Point With Tomi Lahren” on One America News Network, hit talking points repeated by critics of Obama’s terror policy and collected nearly 2 million YouTube views by Tuesday afternoon.
Perhaps it was passages like this that caught the Internet’s attention:
“I care that this s.o.b. killed four of our United States Marines. And I care that our commander in chief is more concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor and sacrifice made by these Marines.””*
