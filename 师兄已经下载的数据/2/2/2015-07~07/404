Turkish week. From anti-Chines moods to Erdoğan’s continues lies over Armenian Genocide
YEREVAN, JULY 11, ARMENPRESS. The scandalous anti-Chinese protests, new developments over forming coalition government as well as the lawsuit against a Turkish nationalist filed by the Armenian member of the Majlis are some of the topics that were actual in the country this week. “Armenpress” followed the developments in Turkey during the last week and presents the most remarkable ones.
Turkey was overwhelmed by anti-Chinese moods. Turkey complained that the Chinese authorities oppressed Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, who are considered to be ethnic Turks in Turkey. Turks think that Uyghurs were allegedly banned to pray and fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It caused widespread discontent in the country. The protesters demanded the Chinese authorities that they stop discriminating Muslims. Anti-Chinese protesters have attacked not only Chinese shops and restaurants but also Korean and Japanese establishments.
Pinnacle of anti-Chinese moods was in Istanbul, where nearly 200 people attacked the building of the Consulate of Thailand, breaking the windows and doors with stones and sticks. They waved posters with “Long live the independent Eastern Turkestan”, “Turkey, stand up for your brother” writings.
After the incident the Embassy of Thailand in Ankara closed for an uncertain time. Besides, the Thai Consulate temporarily ceased its mission in Istanbul.
Formation of the coalition government entered a new phase this week in Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially assigned PM Ahmet Davutoğlu to form the new government. After receiving appropriate assignments, countdown of the 45-day long procedure of forming the government started. Davutoğlu informed the timetable of the meetings with the leaders of other parties represented in the Majlis. According to it, the leader of the ruling party will first meet the Kemalist Republican People’s Party on July 13, then, on July 14, with “Nationalist Movement” party, and on July 15, with the Kurdish People’s Democratic Party.
During this week Erdoğan continued his attempts to misguide the foreign Ambassadors by the stance of official Ankara over the Armenian Genocide. He reaffirmed his suggestion to create a joint commission of historians, again making a statement that they share the pain of the World War I.
Garo Palian elected as a Majlis member from the Kurdish People’s Democratic Party announced that he will file a lawsuit against the Turkish nationalist for threatening “to start preying Armenians” in Kars.
