Donald Trump today took lots of shots at John McCain, including––most shockingly––the fact that he was a prisoner of war while serving in Vietnam Trump’s been feuding with McCain after McCain said Trump is “firing up the crazies” with his outlandish rhetoric, and Trump fired back by calling McCain a “dummy. Trump sat down on stage with pollster Frank Luntz at the Family Leadership Summit and continued to fire back at McCain (while still bragging about the crowd he drew because that’s his modus operandi).
At one point, he said he supported McCain in 2008, but doesn’t like him very much now. Luntz pointed out that McCain’s a war hero, and that’s when Trump said this: “He’s a war hero ’cause he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”
Also, just for the record, Trump got draft deferments. Donald Trump continued his attacks on fellow Republicans by mocking 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s military background, saying “He’s a war hero ’cause he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Speaking with host Frank Luntz, Trump returned fire at McCain who earlier criticized the bombastic businessman for “firing up the crazies” last weekend during a rally in his home state of Arizona.
“He’s a war hero cause he was captured!” Trump said, before adding, “I like people that weren’t captured” causing the audience to laugh.
Trump continued, “He’s a war hero, but right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said was, ‘John McCain, I disagree with him they are crazy.’ And, very importantly — I speak the truth — he graduated last in hi...

Over the weekend Donald Trump made statements saying John McCain was only considered a war hero because he was captured, and that he prefers people who weren’t captured. Comments like these would disqualify most GOP primary contestants, but Trump appears yet unphazed. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. 

\"Each time Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is given a public platform, he manages to offend even more Americans. On Saturday morning he took aim at Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and veterans, saying McCain is “not a war hero” because he was captured during the Vietnam War.

“He’s a war hero cause he was captured,” Trump said during the Family Leadership Summit. “I like people that weren’t captured.”
Trump later told press that he would not apologize to McCain and that McCain picked the fight. The two have been feuding since McCain said that Trump is “firing up the crazies” afterpeople gathered in Arizona to support the candidate who called immigrants from Mexico “rapists.””*

Sen. John McCain criticized the leading Republican presidential candidates Tuesday for their positive statements on waterboarding and torture, calling such comments “loose talk” that goes against American values. In the GOP presidential debate Saturday night, Donald Trump, the front-runner in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary, said he would bring back waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” if elected president. Sen. Ted Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses last week, said that waterboarding didn’t amount to torture, but is simply enhanced interrogation, though he said he wouldn’t bring back its widespread use. Cruz did add, however, that facing an imminent attack, he “would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.” McCain, a Vietnam veteran who spent five years as a prisoner of war, called the comments from his party’s top candidates “disappointing.” “It might be easy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric, but these statements must not go unanswered because they mislead the American people about the realities of interrogation, how to gather intelligence, what it takes to defend our security and, at the most fundamental level, what we are fighting for as a nation and what kind of nation we are,” he said.

The Arizona Republican made his remarks on the Senate floor the same day New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls for the first-in-the-nation primary. McCain is popular figure in that state and won its primary during both his 2000 and 2008 presidential bids.

Unless you’ve lived under a rock, you’ve heard about the impact Donald Trump is having on American Politics. After controversial comments about illegal immigration and crime, Trump has risen to the very top of the polls, making him the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the Presidential Election. 

After a very successful campaign event in Phoenix, John McCain called Trump supporters “crazies,” which lead to a public war of words between the two figures. Recently, Trumps comments about McCain’s status as a war hero have been punched on by the mainstream media and Republican political establishment. Now I want to tell you what pisses me off about Donald Trump and John McCain!

Over the weekend, Donald Trump disparaged Senator John McCain’s military service record, saying he prefers soldiers who weren’t captured. Reporters have now looked into Trump’s activities during the Vietnam war. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"It was the spring of 1968, and Donald Trump had it good.

He was 21 years old and handsome with a full head of hair. He avoided the Vietnam War draft on his way to earning an Ivy League degree. He was fond of fancy dinners, beautiful women and outrageous clubs. Most important, he had a job in his father’s real estate company and a brain bursting with money-making ideas that would make him a billionaire.

“When I graduated from college, I had a net worth of perhaps $200,000,” he said in his 1987 autobiography “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” written with Tony Schwartz. (That’s about $1.4 million in 2015 dollars.) “I had my eye on Manhattan.””*

John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936) is the senior United States Senator from Arizona. He was the Republican presidential nominee in the 2008 United States election.
McCain followed his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator, flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. In October 1967, while on a bombing mission over Hanoi, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture, and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations.
He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, winning re-election easily four times, most recently in 2010. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a "maverick" for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the war in Iraq should be fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee, opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel, and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.
