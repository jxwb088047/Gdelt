Chinese in Turkey warned of anti-Beijing protests | gbtimes.com
China has warned its citizens travelling to Turkey to be careful to avoid the Muslim protests taking place in the country, saying that some Chinese tourists have recently been “attacked and disturbed”.
The protests come in the wake of media reports indicating that Muslim Uyghur people in China’s Xinjiang region had been banned from worship and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.  
The warning, posted on the website of the Chinese Embassy in Turkey, said there have been multiple demonstrations in Turkey against the Chinese government. Reuters reported that several hundred protesters burned a Chinese flag outside the country's consulate in Istanbul on Sunday. The Express reports that a group of protesters - thought to be members of the far right Grey Wolves movement - accidentally attacked a group of Korean tourists, mistaking them for Chinese nationals.
The World Report 2015 recently highlighted the plight of Muslim Uyghurs in China.
