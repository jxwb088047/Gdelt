NSC chief visits China to monitor Uighur situation
BANGKOK, 15 July 2015 (NNT) - National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Anusit Kunakorn is set to depart for China to monitor the living conditions of 109 Uighurs repatriated to Chinese authorities.
The visit is aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of the deported Uighur migrants, as well as holding talks with Chinese officials on human trafficking issues.
The NSC Secretary-General insisted to Chinese officials that the migrants have not committed any crimes and were only repatriated for illegal immigrating to Thailand. Relevant Chinese units expressed concerned over human-trafficking networks in Asia and that the Uighurs will be treated humanely.
Mr Anusit also addressed last year’s downgrade of Thailand’s status in the US Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report to Tier 3, saying the report reflected neglect of the issue in the past. He is confident the government is adjusting its policy to properly address human-trafficking in Thailand and the region.
A group of more than 170 Uighurs were previously identified as Turkish citizens and sent to Turkey, while the 109 were sent to China.

Judging by what's been shown on the net of these people travelling in a plane and being taken from the plane with black hoods......one can only imagine what they could be going through now.
Good luck to K. Anusit on his mission....I'm sure courtesy and respect will be shown to him from while in China.
