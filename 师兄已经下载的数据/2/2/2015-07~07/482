BEIJING — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing on Wednesday, a day after securing North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) backing for Ankara’s fight against Islamic State militants.
Ankara is expanding a cross-border campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria, and also attacking positions of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party in northern Iraq after deadly attacks inside Turkey.
Mr Xi welcomed Mr Erdogan outside Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, where the two leaders inspected a military honour guard before entering the ornate building for their meeting.
"At present we are moving in a constructive direction, bringing more content to our strategic co-operative relationship," Mr Erdogan told Mr Xi.
Mr Xi, meanwhile, said that Mr Erdogan’s visits to China as prime minister and president showed that he was attentive to Chinese-Turkish relations.
"We advocate that China and Turkey should support each other on major issues and deepen their strategic co-operative relationship," Mr Xi said.
Turkey entered discussions in 2013 with a Chinese state-run company over a contract for an antimissile system worth $3.4bn, raising eyebrows among other Nato members.
A final deal has been elusive, with Mr Erdogan noting in an interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency that "impediments" have emerged after an initial Chinese proposal, but also said that the issue would be on the agenda in Beijing.
"Any offer that will enrich this appropriate proposal will be welcomed by us. I believe this visit will give more momentum to bilateral relations," Mr Erdogan said.
Turkey is a Nato member, which on Tuesday strongly backed Ankara’s fight against "terrorism" at an emergency meeting, although some countries expressed concern that strikes on Kurdish fighters could torpedo peace talks with the rebels, who are bitterly opposed to the jihadists.
The visit also comes amid tensions between Ankara and Beijing over China’s Muslim Uighur minority, who have cultural ties with Turkey and speak a Turkic language.
China blames Islamist separatists for violence in the Uighur homeland of Xinjiang, while Turkey has expressed concern about Beijing’s treatment of the minority — with Mr Erdogan in 2009 accusing Beijing of "genocide" in the region.
The two countries engaged in a public row this year over Uighurs who fled China to seek refuge in Thailand, with Turkey offering them shelter against Beijing’s wishes.
Thailand said this month it had deported about 100 Uighurs to China, after sending more than 170 Uighur women and children to Turkey last month.
As tensions over the refugees mounted this month, activists stormed the Thai consulate in Istanbul and burnt the Chinese flag outside Beijing’s consulate in the city. China "strongly condemned" the acts.
Chinese media have repeatedly cited unnamed sources linking Uighurs to jihadist violence in the Middle East, without giving evidence.
As part of a clampdown in Xinjiang, Chinese authorities have launched campaigns against the wearing of headscarves, veils and other Islamic coverings by women and facial hair on men, while also banning fasting during Ramadan.
