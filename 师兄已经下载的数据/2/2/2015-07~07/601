Thailand has reportedly shut down its embassy in Turkey temporarily following widespread protests over the country's decision to deport over 100 Uighurs to China, spokesman Werachon Sukhondhapatipak said.
The decision to close the embassy in Ankara and the consulate in Istanbul came a day after protesters attacked the latter, reported the BBC.
Irate protesters had smashed consulate's windows, damaged furnishings and pulled down the signs outside the building on Thursday. They also burnt Chinese flags outside the Chinese embassy.
The spokesman said that the situation will be assessed on a daily basis.
Rights groups have condemned the country's decision to extradite Uighurs to China, saying they could face possible persecution in the country.
Turkey has witnessed a surge in anger against Chinese authorities for discriminating against Uighurs, who are ethnically Turkic Muslims.
However, China has claimed that it respects the freedom of Muslim beliefs.
