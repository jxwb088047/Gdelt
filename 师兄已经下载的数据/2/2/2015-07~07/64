Jon Stewart Secretly Met With White House
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 29, 2015Leave a Comment
Apparently, in the past few years, President Obama has had two meetings with Jon Stewart. Why would they meet? What might they have discussed? Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show Jon Stewart secretly met with President Barack Obama at the White House on at least two occasions, which were followed with on-air attacks on Obama’s political enemies.
Politico’s Darren Samuelsohn wrote his paper’s farewell to Stewart, who is set to retire from The Daily Show next Thursday. He notes that Stewart had an enormous effect on national politics, but sometimes “that effect took the form of either prodding, or working in concert with, the Obama administration.””*
