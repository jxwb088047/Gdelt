​Three suspected Uyghur 'terrorists' killed in China | gbtimes.com
Police in Shenyang, Liaoning province shot dead three suspected Uyghur terrorists and injured a fourth during what is being described as a counter-terrorism raid on Monday, according to state media Xinhua News Agency. The four, believed to be from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, were reportedly chanting jihadist slogans and wielding long knives and blunt weapons in a rented house when the police entered. A 28-year-old woman and three children were also detained, according to the local government’s official social media account.   South China Morning Post reported the suspected terrorists were believed to be involved in fundamentalist violence in June but were not among the 16 people apprehended over the past month.   The Guardian reported last week that over 100 ethnic Uyghurs deported from Thailand to China last week were, according to Chinese state media, on their way to wage holy war in Turkey, Syria or Iraq.
