America's Racist History Whitewashed Out Of Texas Textbooks
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 7, 2015Leave a Comment
Cenk Uygur (host of The Young Turks) discusses a decision by Texas textbook publishers to put a creative spin on some particularly racist moments in American history. The publishers left out the KKK and Jim Crow laws and have an interesting take on what caused the Civil War. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Social studies books for Texas public schools will minimize the importance of slavery in the Civil War and omit any mention of both Jim Crow laws and the Ku Klux Klan, the Washington Post reported.
Lessons covering the Civil War will list the reasons behind the conflict as being, “sectionalism, states’ rights and slavery,” in that order.
As Business Insider noted, the new textbooks come five years after the state board of education revised the curriculum. Republican board member Pat Hardy stated at the time that he considered slavery “a side issue” in the war.
The books are set to be issued to the state’s 5 million public school students not long after the renewed debate regarding the Confederate flag, spurred by Dylann Roof’s terrorist attack inside a South Carolina church last month that killed nine people, including state Sen. Clementa Pinckney.”*
