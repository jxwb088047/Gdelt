Tiananmen Square activist seeks seat in Taiwan parliament
Wu’er Kaixi, a former student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen movement, will officially launch his campaign Friday for a Taiwan parliament seat.
The ethnic Uighur, who fled China after Beijing crushed the pro-democracy protests 26 years ago, wants to unseat an incumbent legislator from the pro-China Kuomintang (KMT) in a contest in Taichung.
Wu’er, who has made Taichung his adopted home in 1996, has reached a gentlemen’s agreement with a rival from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whereby the one with the least support will endorse the other, Reuters reported.
The goal is not to splinter the opposition vote against incumbent KMT legislator Tsai Chin-long.
“The KMT needs to be normalized. It is an enormous monster,” Wu’er was quoted as saying. “The biggest mission in this campaign is to deepen the democracy of Taiwan.”
Taiwan votes for a new president and legislature next January, and expectations are growing that the main pro-independence DPP will win by a wide margin.
During a June meeting between Wu’er and Chang Liao Wan-chien, the DPP contender vying for the same parliament seat in Taichung, both men agreed that KMT incumbent Tsai Chin-long must be defeated.
Tsai won the Taichung seat in 2012 with 51 percent of the vote.
Wu’er and Chang will decide by mid-September on who will stand when candidates officially register for the national election.
