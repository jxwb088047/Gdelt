Indonesia jails 4th Uighur on terrorism offences - Daily Sabah

An Indonesian court on Wednesday sentenced a Uighur Muslim man to six years in prison on charges of "terrorism" and immigration violations. Earlier this month, the court sentenced three more Uighur Muslims to six years each on the same charges. The panel of judges in the North Jakarta District Court found Ahmet Bozoglan guilty of violating Indonesia's anti-terrorism and immigration laws. The judge also ordered him to pay a fine of Rp 100 million ($7,500), or spend an additional six months in prison.
