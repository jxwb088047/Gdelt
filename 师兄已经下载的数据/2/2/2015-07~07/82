Thai cabinet considers new court for human trafficking, AsiaOne Asia News
THE CABINET has discussed a bill to set up a Criminal Court's Division on Human Trafficking, Deputy Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said yesterday.





 

Don said the bill, which highlights Thailand's efforts to curb human trafficking, was forwarded to the Cabinet for approval as a provisional agenda.
He said the establishment of the court would prove Thailand' s strong determination and sincerity in suppressing the traffic.
Meanwhile 109 Uighurs who were deported from Thailand to China were treated well in accordance with international standards, Don said.
He said that during their first visit, Thai officials had viewed them so they could assure the world community that Thailand had followed international laws and human-rights principles.
Don said Thailand might send officials to follow up on the group in China for a second time. He said it would all depend on whether China would allow third countries to check on the condition of the Uighurs.
Rights groups had earlier expressed concern that the Uighurs, a Muslim Turkic-speaking minority, sent to China would "likely face torture". Thailand had been criticised for deporting the Uighurs, where activists said they faced persecution, abuse and human-rights violations.
