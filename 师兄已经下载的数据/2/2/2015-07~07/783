As a heat wave continues to scorch northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which has topped the list of the hottest places in China for more than a week, Xinjiang people said the difference between them and a steak thrown on a barbecue is a pinch of salt.
"You can literally feel your skin sizzling under the sun. My wife reminded me to bring salt and pepper with me and rotate myself properly so I can be roasted evenly. I know she was just joking, but it's been too hot for too long," said Wang Liyuan, an Urumqi resident. The temperature in the regional capital of Urumqi reached a record 41 C on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the Xinjiang Meteorological Department issued red heat warnings to cities around the region for the seventh day. People in seven of the 16 major cities in the region experienced temperatures over 40 C on Wednesday.
Red represents the most severe weather in a four-tier color-coded weather warning system, followed by orange, yellow and blue. Under the red alert, outdoor work should be suspended due to the risk of heatstroke.
According to the China Central Meteorological Station's website, the top six hottest places in China in the afternoon were all in Xinjiang. Turpan city in Turpan prefecture, also known as the "fire state", topped the chart with temperatures reaching 46 C on Wednesday.
