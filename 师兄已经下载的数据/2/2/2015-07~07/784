‘Watch out for those with slanted eyes!’ - Cihan

In the early 2000s, when the Chinese president was going to visit Turkey, I contributed a piece on China's Turkic Uighurs to the paper I was writing for at the time that was slightly critical of the Chinese treatment of its Uighur minority.Late in the evening, on the same day that the paper I wrote my piece for came out with a supplement on China, I received a phone call telling me that a group of angry Chinese diplomats from the embassy in Ankara had come to the paper's headquarters to object to the contents of my article.Beijing's extreme sensitivity regarding its minorities, and its mistreatment of them, is common knowledge to all familiar with Asian affairs.Another incident I came across in Ankara over China's anger was regarding Taiwan, a breakaway island state from mainland China. Taiwan's liaison office in Ankara has periodically created tension between Ankara and Beijing. On one occasion, for instance, Taiwan hung on the entry of its office in Ankara a sign that increased its status of representation from liaison to representative. The Chinese Embassy protested and ensured the upgraded status of Taiwan -- which China said was implied recognition of its self-declared independence -- be removed from the plate.I became aware of the Uighurs' strong sense of affinity with the people of Turkey in 1990 during a conversation with a man in a library at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in the UK. He started a conversation with me by identifying himself as a Turk from East Turkestan. I could not recognize the geographical location of East Turkestan in Turkey and noticing my failure to identify the area, he said it was in China and that he was a Turkic Uighur.Turkic Uighurs live in the Xinjiang province of China, commonly known in Turkey as East Turkestan.I visited China's Uighur province for the first time in 2013 while covering the visit of a delegation from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) headed by its leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. After Beijing and Shanghai, our last stop was Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, where Turkic Uighurs live. It was quite a short visit to Urumqi, making it hard for me to observe Beijing's pressure on this Muslim population, but its underdevelopment was easy to spot compared to Beijing or Shanghai.Attention to the plight of Turkic Uighurs has resurfaced lately, causing tension between Ankara and Beijing.Angry ultra-nationalist Turks have been attacking all Asians they come across in Turkish cities in protest of reports that the Chinese government has banned these Muslim Turkic Uighurs from practicing their religion and fasting during Ramadan.In one incident, ultra-nationalists beat a cook at a Chinese restaurant in İstanbul who it turned out was a Turkic Uighur. In another, protesters attacked South Korean and Japanese tourists in İstanbul and Ankara because to them they appeared to be Chinese.Turkish ultra-nationalists have created an atmosphere of fear for all Asian nationals, whether they are Koreans, Chinese, Japanese or from the Central Asian republics. I remember warning a woman from Kyrgyzstan and her 4-year-old daughter to watch out against an attack by ultranationalists.China deserves to receive strong condemnation and a civilized reaction to its ill-treatment of Turkic Uighurs. But Turkish ultranationalists' protests have highlighted the high-degree of Turkish racism while demonstrating how extremely xenophobic Turkish society is. It is also a fact that in Sunni-dominated Turkey, Turks' discriminatory attitude towards Alevis, Kurds and all non-Muslim minorities amounts to racism.Another problematic aspect of Turkish ultranationalists' form of protest, which has amounted to racism, is the support given to them by a leading politician.Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli defended last week's protests against the Chinese mistreatment of Muslim Uighurs, saying the nationalist youth of his country should be able to exercise their “democratic right” to protest.Bahçeli played down the ultranationalist attacks on Asian tourists and raised eyebrows when he said: “What is the difference between a Korean and a Chinese? Does it matter? They both have slanted eyes.”Yet Thailand sending back more than 100 Uighur refugees to China last week has rightly drawn harsh criticism from both the Turkish government, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and human rights groups, over concerns that the members of the ethnic minority will face persecution from the Chinese government.At the end of the day, Turkish ultranationalists' unacceptable way of protesting by engaging in physical violence does not help China to lift the pressure it is exerting on Turkic Uighurs but rather has a negative implication on Turkey's ability to attract tourists at a time when their numbers are already declining.LALE KEMAL (Cihan/Today's Zaman)
