China to prosecute deported Uighurs who face serious criminal charges
The NationBANGKOK: -- China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying confirmed on Thursday that Thailand has deported more than 100 Uighur immigrants back to China.
Asked to confirm the report, she replied that the deported immigrants would be brought to justice if they were charged with with serious criminal offences.
"China’s policies on illegal emigrants are clear and consistent. Those charged with serious criminal offences will be brought to justice, while those not charged with criminal offences or only with minor offences will be properly settled," the spokeswoman said.

China is a very racist country in the world, except Han Chinese, they don't consider others as their citizens. The expand their population like pigs, and they extend their territories by cultural genocide first. They will introduce bad eating culture, that allow them to eat literally anything moving on earth, you have to keep an eye on your pets too if you like next door with Chinese. Then next they will introduce prostitution. So, that other civilized community cannot live along them and leave. That's what happening in Zinzinang, and in Tibet. Then Chinese will celebrate their victory. Now they are expanding their sea territory by creating a artificial islands made out of sand. Another danger is that most of China is polluted, so they badly want to migrate to another countries if they have money. They even have migration tour by bringing pregnant ladies to US and part of EU to get citizenship for their new borns and migrate permanently. One day the world will be polluted with full of Chinese.

I like Chinese.
I like Chinese.
They only come up to your knees,
Yet they're always friendly, and they're ready to please.
I like Chinese.
I like Chinese.
There's nine hundred million of them in the world today.
You'd better learn to like them; that's what I say.
I like Chinese.
I like Chinese.
They come from a long way overseas,
But they're cute and they're cuddly, and they're ready to please.
BTW what's small and yellow and runs around saying "cheep, cheep"?

To have been expected - torture & jail. Brilliant move by The General to further ingratiate himself with the Chinese.

Looks like I might see a few of them out here in Iraq, as the company I work for employs many "prisoners" who work their freedom in Iraq, and are cheap labour, and expendable.
Unless they are executed instead. The Chinese here are all afraid of the big bosses who are party members, many tell me that if they step out of line, their families are punished. 
Sounds about right for the Chinese.
This incident will not blow over, and will be seized upon and once again, the juntas heavy handed approach to delicate matters will be questioned.

Properly settled? 
There's a phrase I wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of.

And of course you know that none of the people sent back to China are guilty of any crimes. I don't believe you can have this information , but it seems like you want to bash the military on any subject.
