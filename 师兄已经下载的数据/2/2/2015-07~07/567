Uighurs in China mark Eid amid fresh ethnic strife - Channel NewsAsia
BEIJING: Uighur Muslim minorities in China are marking Eid al-Fitr amid fresh incidents of ethnic strife.
Just this week, police shot dead three Uighur Muslims in Shenyang. Authorities said they were terrorists armed with knives who resisted arrest.
Earlier this month, Thailand deported over 100 Uighurs to China and this drew protests from human rights activists in Turkey. China said they are illegal smugglers and will be punished accordingly.
Xinjiang, a Chinese province which borders Central Asia, is home to the country's Uighur minorities. The region has been restive with sporadic clashes between Han Chinese and Uighurs, whom activists say face suppression in religious freedom and civil rights.
All over China, security was on high alert in places where Uighurs tend to congregate. Police patrol cars lined the junction to Shanghai's Muslim Street, where dozens of stalls peddle Uighur cuisine. Nearly all the stall owners are from Xinjiang, who said they moved to Shanghai to seek better economic conditions.

Lack of development in Xinjiang has been blamed for the ethnic tension. But despite efforts by the government to improve the situation in recent years, many who can, still leave to seek a better life elsewhere.
