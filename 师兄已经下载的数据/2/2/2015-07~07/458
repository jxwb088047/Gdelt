UN Urges China And Thailand To Protect Uighurs | Fulton News
– ‘We strongly urge the Thai authorities to ensure the protection of the 60 individuals (Uighur) who remain in detention’

GENEVA – The United Nations has announced fears for the more than 100 Uighur deported by Thailand to China, calling on Beijing Friday to ensure their safety.
 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Rupert Colville said in a press conference at the UN in Geneva that it was “gravely concerned” by the deportation of 109 people — “including some 20 women” — by the Thai authorities. 
“We call on the Chinese authorities to ensure that those extradited are treated in full conformity with the country’s human rights,” Colville said.
The 109 Uighur were part of a group of around 350 who had been detained at various immigration detention facilities across Thailand since March 2014.
Collville said that they were apprehended while trying to get to Turkey.
“Despite Turkey’s reported willingness to admit them to its territory, only 172 of the 350 were eventually allowed to go to Turkey in late June,” he said 
He added that some 60 others remain in detention in Thailand, and urged authorities to ensure their protection.
Collville asked there be no further deportation of individuals – “including potential refugees and asylum seekers” – to countries where they could face grave human rights violations “including torture.”
“We also urge Thailand to monitor the return of this group and to do all in its power to ensure that they are treated in line with international human rights standards.” 
Uighur — who constitute around 45 percent of the population of Xinjiang – have accused China of carrying out repressive policies that restrain their religious, commercial and cultural activities.
