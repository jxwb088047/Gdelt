China protests US comments on deportation of Uyghurs - People's Daily Online

 The Chinese foreign ministry on Saturday strongly opposed politicization of the recent deportation of illegal immigrants from Thailand, as some of the immigrants had plans to join the Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq.

 Thailand last week deported 109 people to China, who are mainly from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

 Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of the foreign ministry, expressed opposition in response to a recent statement from the US, which dubbed these illegal immigrants as "refugees" and voiced concerns about "harsh treatment" on their return to China.

 Hua said the deportation of these illegal smugglers was in accordance with relevant international conventions and bilateral cooperation treaties.

 Chinese police said that 13 of the deportees are suspected of involvement in terrorism. The illegal immigrants claimed quite a few of them were bewitched by terror videos released by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and World Uyghur Congress, Chinese State broadcaster CCTV reported.

 Hua said, "The US statement, in disregard of the facts and full with political prejudice, is a connivance of illegal immigration and smuggling and also a violation of relevant international conventions and laws."

 China has lodged solemn representations with the US over the latter's criticism.Â
