Turkish anti-Chinese demonstrators stormed the Thai consulate in Istanbul in protest at the deportation by Bangkok of dozens of Uighur Muslims to China, as diplomatic tensions flared Thursday in an increasingly combustible controversy.The attack was the latest in a series of nationalist-tinted protests in Turkey during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan over China's treatment of the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uighurs in the northwestern Xinjiang region.Thailand said it had deported around 100 Uighur Muslims detained in the kingdom since last year to China, in a move sparking fears for the safety of the asylum-seekers.Thai government spokesman Werachon Sukhondapatipak told reporters "some 100" Uighurs were deported to China Wednesday after finding "clear evidence they are Chinese nationals".He also revealed that an earlier group of Uighurs, 172 women and children, were sent to Turkey in late June.
