Chinese Muslims face execution - Fiji Times Online
ABOUT 100 Chinese Muslims could be executed or tortured after being deported from Thailand for reportedly trying to join jihadists in the Middle East.
According to China's official Xinjua news agency, 109 members of the Muslim Uighur minority who fled China had "intended to join jihad" in Turkey, Syria or Iraq.
It cited a report by the ministry of public security, which said a Chinese police investigation had uncovered several gangs recruiting people to fight.
The 109 were originally part of a larger group of nearly 300 migrants who were detained by Thai authorities over a year ago. Another 173 people have been deported to Turkey.
Human rights groups, the UN and the EU have condemned the decision to deport the Uighur people to China where they face oppression.
Omer Kanat, the vice-chairman of the German based human rights group for the Uighur people, the World Uighur Congress told Al Jazeera that the allegations were "total lies".
A spokesman for the group said China was "shirking responsibility for Uighurs fleeing because of its policy of suppression. The so-called radicals are those who hope to flee China and live a stable and dignified life in a safe and free country."
Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia regional director said, "Time and time again we have seen Uighurs returned to China disappearing into a black hole, with some detained, tortured and in some cases, sentenced to death and executed."
Sunai Phasuk, a Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters: "By forcibly sending back at least 90 Uighurs, Thailand has violated international law. In China they can face serious abuses including torture and disappearance."
