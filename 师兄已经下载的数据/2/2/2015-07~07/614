China is Tajikistan’s largest creditor.  According to some data, Tajikistan now owes more than 900 million U.S. dollars to China.
The China Development Bank (CDB) is expected to provide a long-term $500 million loan to the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT).  We will recall that a delegation of the CDB, led by Lu Tao, Vice-President of the CDB’s branch in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), was in Dushanbe in early July to discuss the details of providing the loan to the NBT.  The sides reportedly agreed to continue negotiations on this subject in the near future in Beijing.
