Travel video about destination New England.
The city of Plymouth is the beginning of a journey through the north eastern region of America, New England, which is where the first European settlers landed in the 17th century after stepping off the Mayflower.The ‘Plimouth Plantation’ is a reconstruction of the Pilgrim Fathers’ original settlement, with ‘settlers’ in original costume going about their daily routine. In the centre of Boston, Copley Square features the Trinity Church which contrasts with the modern Hancock Tower that dominates the skyline and Park Street Church was where, in 1829, William Garrison gave his first anti-slavery speech. In the adjacent Granary Burial Ground some of America’s most famous sons are buried, such as John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. Portsmouth is a quaint little harbour town at the mouth of the Piscataqua River in which the fishing harbour still plays an important role and pretty brick houses are gems of colonial architecture that remain untainted by tourism. Brunswick is a deceptively small town situated at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The main attraction of this 270 year old town is Bowdoin College in which theologian Calvin Stowe taught, husband of Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The fishing town of Rockland is one of the largest exporters of lobster in the USA. There’s nowhere better to enjoy fresher, tastier and more varied seafood than on this part of the coast. Indeed, three quarters of American lobsters and other fish are prepared here. Established in 1919, Acadia National Park extends across most ...

New England is a region in the northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. New England is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Canada (the Canadian Maritimes and Quebec) and the state of New York.
In one of the earliest English settlements in North America, Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620, to form Plymouth Colony. Ten years later, the Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston, thus forming Massachusetts Bay Colony. Over the next 130 years, New England fought in four French and Indian Wars, until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America. In the late 18th century, the New England Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists. The Boston Tea Party was a protest that angered Great Britain, which responded with the "Intolerable Acts", stripping the colonies of self-government. The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775, the expulsion of the British from New England in spring 1776, and the Declaration of Independence in July 1776.
