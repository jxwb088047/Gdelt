Description:
Today one of our biggest concerns is maximizing what we have to get the most out of our day and our dollar. For many of us, time is very limited and between our jobs, taking care of the kids, finishing off household chores and checking off endless family obligations, there just isn’t that much spare time left. In addition to time concerns, we all have varying degrees of worry over money, savings and how we can get the most from every dollar. Combined, these pressures of time and money can make our daily lives a real challenge sometimes. Sometimes the juggling can be a bit much for people, but there are some small techniques, or hacks, that can alleviate a bit of the pressure.
Food and eating is one area where people either just don’t have the time, the equipment or the money to do things properly. How many times have you tried to cut something and been forced to use a dull or improper knife? How often have you been in such a rush that you think you don’t have time to prepare a proper meal? How often have you ended up throwing out a lot of food because you just lost track of time and it went bad? When you think of the amount of wasted money, time restrictions and frustration we experience in relation to food, it’s no wonder most of us don’t eat properly. After all, it often just seems easier to grab some fast food or go to the store to buy those special baked goods. ...

10 Celebrities You Didn\'t Know Were Gay https://youtu.be/YB0xLNy4Ktc

Description:

For most of us, we are happy with a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, hamburger and fries or a sandwich when it comes to meal time. Of course, not everyone eats as we do. Around the world, different regions and cultures eat a variety of foods which we have never seen or even heard of. Fruits, meats and spices come in different forms and have varying importance depending on where you live. Often, cultural practices and regional restrictions dictate what many people in different regions eat. For instance, maritime countries often have a bounty of seafood with fewer dishes related to beef or pork. Other nations may have diets high in chicken or lamb while some may rely heavily on vegetable and fruit based diets. 
All of this variety results in a world where the definition of what constitutes food is very broad. For instance, the fried tarantula treat of south-east Asia doesn’t seem out of place to the indigenous population. However, bring some fried eight-legged treats to North America and we’re betting more than a few people would be grossed out. There is such a broad variety of things that people are willing to eat that naturally some dangerous items work their way ...

Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort to produce energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
Historically, people secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering, and agriculture. Today, most of the food energy consumed by the world population is supplied by the food industry.
Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.
The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".
