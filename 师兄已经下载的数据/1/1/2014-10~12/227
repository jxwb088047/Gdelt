PARIS, December 4 (TCA) — Ten people have gone on trial in Paris for alleged links to the financing of Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), AP reported.
As RFE/RL informs, the suspects, who are described as mainly of Turkish origin, are alleged to have collected thousands of euros from people at mosques in several European countries to send to the IMU from 2003 until their arrest in 2008.The trial, the first-ever concerning the IMU in a Paris court according to the presiding judge, was expected to detail funding in the global jihadist movement.According the lawyers for two of the defendants, the charges against their clients are wrong, the collected money was for ‘humanitarian’ uses such as for buying sheep for slaughter for the Muslim festival of Eid.The defendants are also accused of ties to an Islamic militant sentenced for plotting to crash a plane into the mausoleum of the founder of modern Turkey.The IMU, which was formed to overthrow the Uzbek government and create an Islamic caliphate in Central Asia, is officially considered a terrorist group by the United States and linked with al-Qaeda by UN Security Council.
