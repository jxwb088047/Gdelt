The Young Turk\'s Cenk Uygur recently appeared at the Conference to Restore the Republic at San Francisco State University. In his speech, he addressed many reasons why money needs to be taken out of politics, corporate personhood, and the current state of politics. Why do politicians ignore overwhelming polls of what voters want? It turns out, Democrats and Republicans agree on more than you might think; the power of money is astounding. 

Is democracy lost at a national level? In short: yes. Cenk explains fully why this is, but the solution is to remove the corrupting power of money from politics so that our representatives will represent us again instead of corporate donor and lobbyist money.

After officially solving the Urumqi bombing case, the authorities
arrested more than 200 Uygur suspects in the name of
anti-terrorism, mainly young people.
There were two contiguous bombings with more than 200 deaths
within one month.
Let\'s see the other views.

May 25, Xinjiang police implemented a zero clock arrest
plan in Hotan, Kashgar, Aksu.
According to the mainland report, the arrested so-called
terror suspects were mostly Uygurs born in the 80\'s and 90\'s.
The authorities claimed to round up 23 so-called gangs about
200 suspects and seize more than 200 pieces of
explosive devices.

Mainland human rights lawyer Sui Muqing: \"how could more
than 200 suspects confess so suddenly?
It is incredible and absurd.
The majority of the arrested people might be guilty since the current
law is their final say.
I guess they arrested those people they worry a little usually with
an excuse which can only intensify conflict.\"

May 22 morning, bombings happened at the north street of Urumqi
Cultural Palace Park.
It was the second terrorist incident in Xinjiang within one month.

May 23, the authorities announced the bombings has been solved,
four suspects were killed and one arrested.
Since the case has been solved, how can they arrest more than
200 people so-called suspects on May 25?

Younger Uygurs in Xinjiang benefit from close relations between different ethnic groups. Many of them study at schools and colleges in other provinces. They hope for a stable and united society.

A college student in Fuzhou said, \"I was born to an ordinary family. My father is a pilot. Thanks to government policies, he is allowed to join the army. He is really proud of that. I want everybody to realize that only when the society is stable, can we enjoy a better life.\"

A high school student in Beijing said, \"Our class has students from seven ethnic groups. We live in big and bright dorms, equipped with air-conditioners, TVs and telephones. \"

Republicans consistently complain about the President’s strategy on ISIS, yet offer no real alternatives as to how they would address the issue. Meanwhile, Democrats - for fear of looking weak - advocate bombings and military action, without explaining how that will create a stable, long-term solution to the ISIS problem. Here, Cenk gives his thoughts on what would be the most sensible, realistic way to approach the threat posed by ISIS.

In this, the first installment of \"The Uygur Maneuver,\" The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur (http://twitter.com/cenkuygur) breaks down his detailed solution.

The Uyghurs (Uyghur: ئۇيغۇر‎, ULY: Uyghur; [ʔʊjˈʁʊː]; simplified Chinese: 维吾尔; traditional Chinese: 維吾爾; pinyin: Wéiwú'ěr) are a Turkic ethnic group living in Eastern and Central Asia. Today, Uyghurs live primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. An estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in the southwestern portion of the region, the Tarim Basin.
The largest community of Uyghurs outside Xinjiang in China is in Taoyuan County, in south-central Hunan province. Outside of China, significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Smaller communities are found in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkey.
Uyghur is often pronounced /ˈwiːɡər/ by English speakers, though the most acceptable English pronunciation is ooy-goor. Several alternate romanizations also appear: Uighur, Uygur and Uigur. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region provincial government recommends that the generic ethnonym [ʔʊjˈʁʊː], adopted in the early 20th century for this Turkic people, be transcribed as "Uyghur".
