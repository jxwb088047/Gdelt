China Post to issue stamps for Xinjiang corps - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
China Post Group will issue a set of special stamps on Tuesday to commemorate the 60th founding anniversary of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
The stamps will feature the corps' trailblazing history and glorious present, as well as its role in maintaining stability and safeguarding the border areas in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the group said in a statement on Monday.
The commemorative set of three stamps has a face value of 3.6 yuan (about 60 US cents).
Established in October 1954, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is an important part of Xinjiang given its functions of promoting unity among ethnic groups, maintaining social stability and strengthening national border defense.
The Chinese government on Sunday released a white paper on the corps and lauded its "indelible contributions" to the development of Xinjiang.
