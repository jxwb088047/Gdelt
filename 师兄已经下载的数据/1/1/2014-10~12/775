The 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted from 20 March to 1 May 2003 and signaled the start of the Iraq War, which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States (prior to 19 March, the mission in Iraq was called Operation Enduring Freedom, a carryover from the War in Afghanistan).The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba\'athist government of Saddam Hussein. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by American forces.

President George W. Bush had a dream that Iraq would become a beacon of hope in the Middle East. Now, with the region wracked by chaos, civil war, and violence, some U.S. presidential candidates are pledging to order American “boots on the ground” again in Iraq – this time to fight ISIS. The crucial question is: do we understand the Iraq we would be going back to? CNN’s Fareed Zakaria will take a timely look at the reality of what is left of Iraq in Long Road to Hell: America in Iraq.

Zakaria asks tough questions of many of the key architects of America’s military intervention in Iraq over the last dozen years: Who is responsible for the unraveling of Iraq? Do those who want to send American troops to Iraq again understand the mistakes of the past? And, is Iraq even a country anymore?

Zakaria was himself an early supporter of the 2003 military intervention in Iraq. Explaining how his views evolved over time, Zakaria points out the consequences of the major strategic choices. He argues there were too few troops sent to maintain post-war order once the American-led coalition had conquered Saddam’s army. And, greater inclusion of the sectarian groups in Iraq could have meant more regional support for the nation-building efforts that followed the collapse of the Baathist regime.

In Long Road to Hell, Zakaria examines these vital pivot points and mistakes – some previously unknown until now. Offering answers and exploring the challenges are:

What was life really like in Saddam’s Iraq? This week’s offering is the definitive documentary on the cult of Saddam Hussein. Filmed just before the first Gulf war, it depicts a prosperous and sophisticated society in which every aspect of life is coloured by ‘love’ for the ‘Great Leader’. Darkly ironic, this film captures the surreal and Orwellian nature of life under Saddam Hussein. In a country which today has lost even its most basic services, the testimony of this vanquished middle-class and the prosperity of their society resonates on many levels.

Iraqi security forces recaptured a large part of the city of Ramadi this week in one of their most significant military victories over the Islamic State (IS) to date.

Backed by warplanes from the US-led coalition, Baghdad\'s troops have been fighting to secure territory around Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s vast western province of Anbar, since it fell to IS in May.

VICE News embedded with Iraq’s Special Operations Forces, also known as the Golden Division, who have been leading operations to recapture the city.

The First Battle of Fallujah, also known as Operation Vigilant Resolve, was an operation to root out extremist elements of Fallujah and an act of retaliation to, as well as an attempt to apprehend the perpetrators of, the killing of four U.S. contractors in April 2004.
The chief catalyst for the operation was the highly publicized killing and mutilation of four Blackwater USA private military contractors,and the killings of five American soldiers in Habbaniyah a few days earlier.
The battle polarized public opinion within Iraq.
The Second Battle of Fallujah—code-named Operation Al-Fajr and Operation Phantom Fury—was a joint American, Iraqi, and British offensive in November and December 2004, considered the highest point of conflict in Fallujah during the Iraq War. It was led by the U.S. Marine Corps against the Iraqi insurgency stronghold in the city of Fallujah and was authorized by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government. The U.S. military called it \"some of the heaviest urban combat U.S. Marines have been involved in since the Battle of Huế City in Vietnam in 1968.

EXCLUSIVE: VICE News Meets Barack Obama: http://bit.ly/1wT03Bi
Last summer, the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) swept from Syria into northern Iraq, routing Iraqi security forces and seizing the city of Mosul. Soon afterward, the group declared the establishment of a dubious \"caliphate\" in the area it controls and rebranded itself the Islamic State. With Iraq\'s army weakened and radical militants advancing on Baghdad, the country\'s Iran-backed Shia militias — which have their own history of sectarian abuses — fought back, halting the Islamic State\'s progress.

The militias have successfully combated Islamic State fighters on the ground with the assistance of air strikes from a US-led military coalition. But their growing influence within Iraq\'s government amid accusations that they have harmed Sunnis in areas that they control has led many to fear that the militias threaten the country\'s fragile sectarian and political balance.

VICE News traveled to Iraq in December to witness firsthand how Shia militias are taking the fight to the Islamic State, and to document the fallout of their controversial rise to power.

One of the largest decisions weighing on the shoulders of prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau is what role, if any, should Canada play in the war against ISIS. And how will Canadians know whether their efforts are having the intended results? Do we really know what our troops are doing in Iraq? Do we even know whether Coalition airstrikes are hitting intended targets?Bob McKeown reports from the front lines of Canada\'s war in Iraq and Syria.

Deep behind ISIS lines, two brave people agreed to talk to the fifth estate about what life is really like under brutal occupation. One is Rami, a young man who tells us his story as he sees his town destroyed and its citizens terrorized -- fearing all the while that he will be found out and killed. The other, Leila, is a journalist who made a treacherous journey overland to meet our team in Erbil, Iraq. She documents what she says is the little-known toll of civilian casualties from Coalition air strikes. Through their stories, a narrative emerges about fear of ISIS and of the bombs dropped from the sky. The fifth estate explores how the true reality of this war is hidden from all.

Iraq (/ɪˈræk/ or i/ɪˈrɑːk/; Arabic: العراق‎ al-‘Irāq); officially the Republic of Iraq (Arabic:  جمهورية العراق (help·info) Jumhūriyyat al-‘Irāq), is a country in Western Asia spanning most of the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, the eastern part of the Syrian Desert and the northern part of the Arabian Desert.
Iraq borders Syria to the northwest, Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Jordan to the southwest and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the south. Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf. The capital city, Baghdad is in the center-east of the country.
Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run through the center of Iraq, flowing from northwest to southeast. These provide Iraq with agriculturally capable land and contrast with the steppe and desert landscape that covers most of Western Asia.
Historically, Iraq was the center of the Abbasid Arabic Islamic Empire. Iraq has been known to the west by the Greek toponym 'Mesopotamia' (Land between the rivers) and has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing, law and the wheel. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Abbasid empires. It was also part of the Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.
