JAKARTA, INDONESIA: The National Police have stated that the two men arrested on Wednesday in Bekasi, West Java, may have links to the Santoso-led East Indonesian Mujahidin (MIT) group, which is known to be affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) movement.
National Police chief Gen. Badrodin Haiti said that Arif Hidyatullah, alias Abu Mush’ab, and a Chinese Uighur, only identified as Alli, were arrested for allegedly planning attacks on Christmas and New Year festivities.
“Yes, the foreign national is part of that cell. The other [is also connected to] militants in Sukoharjo [Central Java] while the Chinese Uighur is affiliated with the Poso group,” he said.
Badrodin said that following the arrest of the two suspects, police investigators also discovered that Alli had arrived in the area two months earlier and had been using a fake identification card under the name Fariz Kusuma.
“We are currently interrogating those in question. [Alli] has been using an Indonesian identity all this time. However, he could not produce a passport when we arrested him,” Badrodin said.
Based on information collected during the ongoing interrogation, police have come to believe that Arif was a facilitator for the groups and that he was affiliated with and was also taking orders from a man named Bahrunnaim.
Police suspect that Alli was being groomed to become a suicide bomber.
Alli is not the first captured foreign national affiliated with Santoso’s group. Last year, police arrested four Chinese Uighurs who were on the way to meet Santoso, the country’s most wanted terrorist.
Separately, National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan confirmed that the police’s counterterrorism squad Densus 88 was currently hunting down two other terrorist suspects, Nur Rohman and Andika, who were also associated with Arif and Alli.
Anto said that Nur Rohman allegedly collected explosive material that would later be given to Andika for assembly. Andika is a known bomb-maker.
“What is clear now is that we are hunting them down. We have already detected their whereabouts,” he said.
The National Police have stepped up security following the deadly terror attacks in Paris, France, and in preparation for Christmas and New Year festivities.
Prior to Wednesday’s arrests, the National Police had also arrested nine terrorist suspects across Java during a two-day operation starting last Friday. The nine men are suspected of planning a series of attacks on churches and police stations spread across Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan.
The police believe that the nine men were part of a militant group based in Klaten, Central Java.
Meanwhile, terrorism expert Al-Chaidar told The Jakarta Post that the number of foreign nationals joining local militant groups was so small that it should not be of great concern to the authorities.
“There are very few [foreign nationals joining local militant groups]. We know that the police are still going after two more Chinese Uighurs. That being said, Chinese Uighurs often come to Indonesia because they are largely ignored by radical groups in countries such as Turkey, or in Middle-Eastern countries,” Al-Chaidar, who is also known as a former member of the radical group Islamic State of Indonesia (NII), said.
Although the number was small, Al-Chaidar said that the government should continue to be cautious and make it difficult for potential terrorists to enter the country.
“We have to reconsider the concept of visa-on-arrival because it can be misused by foreigners,” he said.
Security officials have also been on alert of late after revelations that at least 297 Indonesian nationals have joined the IS movement in Syria.
Indonesia ranked 31st from 162 countries surveyed in the Institute for Economics and Peace’s 2014 Global Terrorism Index, scoring 4.67 on a scale of 1 to 10.
