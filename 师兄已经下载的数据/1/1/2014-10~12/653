Hacking has been one of the most talked about activities of late. A Canadian research group announces this morning that Chinese hackers are targeting activists and human right groups. The hackers are using the same high tech software and techniques that has been responsible for stealing sensitive information from corporations all over the world.
For activists and groups it is difficult to find a way for them to defend themselves against such advanced equipment. These individuals don’t have a way for fighting back, so they are forced to be the subject of torment to these hackers.  
China doesn’t believe that they have any hacking issues and they have publicly admitted that they don’t know of any involvements between China and hacking activities throughout the world. They have recently stated that they would work to “jointly safeguard peace and security, openness and cooperation in cyberspace," a foreign ministry spokeswoman said.
The ethnic minority groups in China beg to differ, groups like Tibetans, Uighurs, and religious groups all have been subject to attacks by hackers at one point or another. They believe that these Malware attacks against these groups have been happening since 2002.
Citizen Lab a Canadian research group has decided to look into the matter a little further than other cyber security companies. They state that they have enough sufficient evidence to reassure the public that China was behind many of those hacks that affected human right groups and activists. 
"There's no doubt about it. This is something that is, if not carefully orchestrated by the government of China, is certainly tolerated by them and they benefit from it," said Citizen Lab director Ron Deibert.
These groups at one point or another were targeted by the hackers, once they were satisfied with what they saw they would move to the next group. One thing is for certain these hackers are capable of accessing governmental information, let’s just hope they don’t.
