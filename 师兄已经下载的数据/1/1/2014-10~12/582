T20 World Cup 2016 - Pakistan Vs Bangladesh 

India have never beaten New Zealand in T20Is and this stat could have a significant bearing on both the sides when they lock horns in the opening game of the World T20.

Playing XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni (C), Ravindra Jadeja, Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit Bumrah.

New Zealand Team

Playing XI: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (C), Colin Munro, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Grant Elliott, Luke Ronchi, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult.

Match: India vs New Zealand, ICC World T20, 2016

Date: Tuesday, March 15, 2016

Venue: Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, Nagpur


 MS Dhoni\'s Indian team is the team to beat in the ICC World T20, 2016. Everything points towards a successful campaign for the side. Familiarity of home conditions is an added advantage to a side that has been in excellent form in T20Is in the build-up to the premier event. For a team that boasts of the premier T20 league in the world, the side\'s performances in World T20 hasn\'t quite mirrored the expectations. They won the inaugural event in 2007 and were the finalists last time around in 2014 but in the three editions in between, they failed to make it to the knockout stages. This time around, the squad looks a settled one with more all-rounders suited to the conditions. With the momentum behind them, they...

Pakistan (i/ˈpækɨstæn/ or i/pɑːkiˈstɑːn/; Urdu: پاکستان) (Urdu pronunciation: [paːkɪˈst̪aːn] ( listen)), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Urdu: اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان), is a sovereign country in South Asia. It sits at the crossroads of the strategically important regions of South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. It has a 1,046-kilometre (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west and north, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and it shares a marine border with Oman.
The territory of modern Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures, including the Neolithic Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and has undergone invasions or settlements by Hindu, Persian, Indo-Greek, Islamic, Turco-Mongol, Afghan and Sikh cultures. Thus the area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and India's struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of India where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh.
