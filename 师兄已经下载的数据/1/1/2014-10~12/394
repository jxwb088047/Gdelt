Beijing: Malaysia has detained 155 Uighur immigrants from China's volatile Muslim-majority Xinjiang province as part of its attempts to beef-up efforts to prevent militants from joining the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq, official media here reported.
Those detained included 76 children, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported quoting Malaysian media reports.
The Uighur migrants were reportedly found in a raid conducted on two apartment units in Taman Bukit Jalil in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.
Kuala Lumpur Immigration Department enforcement operations unit chief Basri Hassan said that 65 of the illegal immigrants, including 32 children, were crammed into one apartment unit, while the other 90, including 44 children, were found in the second unit.
Malaysia has tightened security at all immigration checkpoints following four Chinese Uighur militants linked to the Islamic State group had transited in Malaysia before being arrested in Indonesia, the report said.
