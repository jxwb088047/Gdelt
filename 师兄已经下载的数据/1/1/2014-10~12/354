This August, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit Ludian, in southwest China's Yunnan Province. A young Uygur entrepreneur then spent more than 40 hours bumping along the road with 1,400 boxes of his traditional Xinjiang nut cakes to the epicenter. The story has been circulated widely on microblogs, and earned him widespread public praise. Now as National Day comes, the young man spoke to our reporter Xia Ruixue about what motivated him to do good.
24-year-old Adil Memettur is a young entrepreneur who runs an online shop selling Xinjiang nut cakes or Qiegao, a traditional snack of his hometown. He became well-known by the whole country during the 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Ludian, southwest China’s Yunnan Province this August. He donated the entire stock of his small business and distributed them all to those in the quake zone.
"I saw in the news that they face shortages of water and food. I felt sorry for them and wanted to do something to help. We donated 5,000 kilograms of nut cakes which were worth around 500,000 yuan. It’s ready to eat, and is dense in protein and sugar," Adil said.
"We cut and packaged the tons of nut cakes overnight. We spent all our funds and the store had run out of cakes. So we had to explain to online customers and asked them to wait. They were quite supportive. After we were back, we had to borrow money to buy raw materials to continue making the nut cakes. But we don’t regret it. We’re really happy that we could help," Jiang Jinya, general manager of Hunan Meng Xiang Qi Hang e-Commerce Co., said.
Adil was born in Kashgar City in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. He learned how to make the nut cakes as a boy.
In 2012, there was a fight between a villager in Yueyang, Hunan province and the ethnic Uygurs over as some complained the extremely high price they were charging for nut cakes. The debate moved online, and after seeing it, Adil got the idea to sell the traditional snack himself.
Later that year, he started his online shop in Changsha with his two classmates from Changsha University of Science and Technology.
"I do worry people’s misunderstanding of Xinjiang will deepen because of the incident and the terrorist attacks. So that’s why I wanted to sell the authentic and affordable nut cakes. I hope we can stand together no matter what happens. Because we are all Chinese," Adil said.
The recent wave of terrorists attacks has caused some misunderstanding about Xinjiang but Adil hopes to leave his customers for positive taste both nut cake and his home town.
The story of Adil and his cake has been circulated widely on microblog, with more than 50,000 netizens praising his charitable deeds in the earthquake.
Adil’s business is also booming with a daily turnover of 200,000 yuan. His shop is now the top seller of nut cakes on Taobao. Adil and his two classmates said they will continue to help others in the future.
