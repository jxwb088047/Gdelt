A court in Xinjiang sentenced 12 people to death for organizing and spearheading “a violent terror attack” in July in the northwestern Chinese province.
Fifteen others were sentenced to death with two year reprieve, while nine people received life imprisonment and 20 others prison sentences from four to 20 years, according to a report today carried by Tianshannet, a news website controlled by the Xinjiang provincial government.
The sentences come as China cracks down on what it calls a surge in terrorism in the frontier region. Ninety-six people were killed in clashes between police and a mob in Xinjiang on July 28 amid celebrations to mark the end of the month-long Ramadan festival, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
Those defendants who turned themselves in received “relatively lenient” sentences, the Tianshannet report said. Public prosecutors used the defendants’ native language and the court has assigned lawyers to ensure their rights, it said.
