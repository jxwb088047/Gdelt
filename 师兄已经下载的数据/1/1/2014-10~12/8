En la ciudad china de Nanjing una furgoneta atropelló y pasó por encina de un niño de 4 años y este tuvo la fortuna de sobrevivir.
Según las imágenes que muestra la cámara de vigilancia, el niño estaba persiguiendo a otra niña instantes antes del incidente. 
El conductor, en su declaración ante la Policía, indicó que no vio al niño debido al llamado \'punto ciego\', y que pensó que había pasado por encima un pozo. No le dio importancia y siguió adelante.
Según su papá, el niño este solo sufrió heridas menores.

China (i/ˈtʃaɪnə/; Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; see also Names of China), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is the world's most-populous country, with a population of over 1.3 billion. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres, the East Asian state is the world's second-largest country by land area, and the third- or fourth-largest in total area, depending on the definition of total area.
The People's Republic of China is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party of China. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four directly controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). Its capital city is Beijing. The PRC also claims Taiwan—which is controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity—as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War. The PRC government denies the legitimacy of the ROC.
