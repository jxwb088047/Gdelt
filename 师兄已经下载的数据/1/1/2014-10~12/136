They stated that they would create a green channel for timely release of funds for development projects initiated by China in Pakistan. The prime minister was pleased that over the last year both sides have achieved better understanding on various projects related to energy and infrastructure. He said that Pakistan supported China’s stance on all major issues, especially on those involving China’s core interests. Nawaz agreed that Pakistan would strengthen cooperation with China in building infrastructure, cracking down on terrorist forces such as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, and maintaining regional stability. China blames the East Turkestan Islamic Movement for carrying out attacks in Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, though many foreign experts doubt the group’s existence in a cohesive group.China, Pakistan’s only major ally in the region, has long urged Islamabad to weed out what it says are militants from Xinjiang, who are holed up in a lawless tribal belt, home to a lethal mix of militant groups, including the Taliban and al Qaeda. The meetings were held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere displaying strong mutual trust, cooperation and convergence of views of the two countries.
