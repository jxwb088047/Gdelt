Mainland extends high-speed rail network to Xinjiang - The China Post
A bullet train capable of speeds of up to 250 kilometers an hour departed the Western Chinese city of Lanzhou for Xinjiang's capital Urumqi, with female attendants in ethnic costumes serving 622 passengers, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) showed.
The line, the first connecting Xinjiang to a neighboring region, stretches through rugged terrain including vast deserts, the high-altitude Qilian mountain range, an ancient section of the Great Wall and strong wind zones, slashing travel time between the two cities by half to under 12 hours, CCTV said.
China also launched two other fast rail lines on Friday, meaning more than 3,200 kilometers (1,984 miles) of high-speed track was put into use in a single day, highlighting the rapid development of the country's network.
The Western high-speed railway comes as China is pushing a Silk Road Economic Belt to boost commercial ties with countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, and ultimately to Europe.
Also opening on Friday were lines linking the prosperous southern commercial hub of Guangzhou with Guiyang in the underdeveloped province of Guizhou, and Nanning in neighboring Guangxi province, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
China has long boasted an extensive rail system but in recent years has pushed the development of super-fast trains that have slashed travel times between major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and made rail travel competitive with flying.
