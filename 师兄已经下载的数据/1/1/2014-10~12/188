Shandong Promotes Uygur and Han Friendship - All China Women's Federation
An activity to promote Uygur and Han Chinese friendship was organized by the Shandong Women's Federation, Shandong Assisting Xinjiang Office, and the headquarters of the Shandong Assisting Xinjiang Office from October 27 to November 11 in Shandong, a coastal province in east China. Fifty families from Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region joined various communication activities in Jinan, Dongying, Jining, Taian and Rizhao.
From October 28 to October 31, the families visited Spouting Spring, Daming Lake, Thousand Buddha Mountain, Mount Taishan and other places of interest to explore the charm of Shandong's traditional culture. They also visited Shandong Ruyi Group, Taikai Group, ZRBC Group and Dongying Economic and Technological Development Zone to learn about advanced technology and the great achievements being made in Shandong. Families' communication activities were dynamic and varied, including entering normal family life in Shandong, making couplets and dumplings and exchanging gifts. Mothers from Shandong donated hand-knitted sweaters to children in Kashgar.
It was the first time Shandong had hosted an activity to implement the policy of promoting communication between Shandong and Xinjiang.
