Bill de Blasio Is Being Floated for 2016. Here's Why That Doesn't Make Any Sense. - Worldnews.com

Predictions that a New York politician would be the Democratic nominee for president in 2016 have set the city's political realm abuzz. The politician in question, however, isn't Hillary Clinton. It's a politician with a decidedly shorter

Ahead of 2016, Rand Paul has a top voice in liberal politics concerned for the Democratic party. Bill de Blasio, New York City's first-term mayor, told journalist Mike Allen he thinks the Kentucky senator is the most formidable opponent for Democrats. Speaking at a Politico Playbook breakfast Wednesday morning, the mayor said his party needs to refocus its message on economic...
With Congress moving legislation to give the White House more authority on trade legislation, President Obama is looking to allay the fears of some of his biggest supporters on the left.

Martin O'Malley has lots to say about his support for same-sex marriage.

PHOENIX, Arizona – The annual Netroots Nation conference has attracted thousands of liberal activists, the core of the Democratic Party's base, to the 100-degree-plus desert heat.

http://democracynow.org - The New York Police Department is facing criticism after arresting an adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio Tuesday night. Five Mualimm-ak was arrested while attempting to mediate a police confrontation with a homeless man in midtown Manhattan. Five Mualimm-ak had just left an event at George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, where he read his essay in the book \"Hell is a Very Small Place,\" about his five years in solitary confinement. Since being released from prison in 2012, Five Mualimm-ak has become a prominent advocate for previously incarcerated men and women. He serves on Mayor de Blasio’s Task Force on Behavioral Health and the Criminal Justice System. He was arrested Tuesday along with fellow prison activist Joseph \"Jazz\" Hayden. Five other people who attended the book reading were later arrested at the police precinct, where they went to inquire about the arrest of Five Mualimm-ak and Hayden. They were charged with \"refusal to disperse.\" We speak to Five Mualimm-ak and two other activists connected with Incarcerated Nation Corp., Joseph \"Jazz\" Hayden and Terrence Slater. All three were arrested on Tuesday.

New York radio station WNYC was recently discussing Mayor Bill de Blasio when a caller who identified as “Louie from the village” called in. Louie defended the mayor and criticized the New York Times for their attacks on him. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"“You know,” he began, “I really like this mayor.”

Quickly, listeners at home and the station’s producers seemed to place the speaker: Louis in the Village, they said, was almost certainly the comedian Louis C.K.

The case for this argument was simple: The caller sounded remarkably similar to Louis C.K., who has in the past expressed a fondness for WNYC, and the comedian has a friendly history with Mr. de Blasio.”*
