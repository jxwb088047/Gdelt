APA - Eight sentenced to death for attacks in China's Xinjiang

 Baku – APA. A court in China condemned eight people to death Monday for two deadly attacks in the violence-torn region of Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority, APA reports quoting France Presse.

 The Urumqi Intermediate People's Court in the capital of Xinjiang also handed out suspended death sentences to five others.

 On April 30, as Chinese President Xi Jinping was wrapping up a tour to the ethnic region, an explosion shook the Urumqi train station, killing three people, injuring 79 people. About three weeks later, on May 22, four men drove two SUVs through a crowded market in central Urumqi and tossed explosives out of car windows, leaving 39 dead and wounding 94.
