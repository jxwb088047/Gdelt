Urumqi terrorists sentenced to die - Global Times
A court in Urumqi, capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, sentenced eight men to death on Monday for the bombing of a Urumqi train station and a terror attack on a local market the following month. Ahmat Rixit, one of the culprits behind the explosion at Urumqi South Railway Station in April, and Abliz Dawut, who participated in the attack on an open-air market in the city in May, were sentenced to death by the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi. China Central Television (CCTV) reported that six others who were involved in the two attacks were also sentenced to death. Another five were sentenced to death with reprieve and four others were sentenced to various jail terms, CCTV said. On April 30, two ethnic Uyghurs stabbed passengers with knives and set off bombs at the exit of Urumqi South Rail Station, killing both themselves and a civilian and injuring another 79. According to previous media reports, Ismail Yusup, a member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a terror group, recruited Rixit and nine other people to manufacture the explosive devices that were used in the train station attack. In cooperation with the International Criminal Police Organization, Chinese police are hunting Ismail Yusup who is believed to be currently outside China, the Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.In an interview with CCTV on Monday, Rixit refused to admit that he had committed a crime and said that he "would do anything to protect his faith."The other terror attack took place on the morning of May 22 when two vehicles, without license plates, broke through roadside fences and plowed into people at an open-air market at Gongyuanbei Street near Renmin Park. The perpetrators also set off explosive devices, leaving 31 dead and 94 injured. Dawut told CCTV that he did these things because he believes that "the holy war is the right thing to do."Lawyers who represented Rixit and Dawut declined to answer questions when reached by the Global Times on Monday.
