Attack in western China kills 15, injures 14 - Asian Correspondent
BEIJING (AP) — Chinese state media say 15 people have been killed in an attack in the country’s troubled western Xinjiang region.
The official Xinhua News Agency says 14 other people were injured in what it said was a terrorist attack Friday in Shache county.
The Tianshan news portal said Saturday that the attackers used vehicles, knives and explosives in the assault. It said the dead included 11 of the attackers.
Such attacks have claimed dozens of lives in Xinjiang over the past year. Members of the region’s Muslim Uighur (WEE-gur) minority group have bristled under what they say is repressive Chinese government rule.
