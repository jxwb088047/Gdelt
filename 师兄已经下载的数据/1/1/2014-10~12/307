Piano prodigy has a ton of talent for a ten-year-old - NY Daily News

 When other 5-year-olds were tickling their Elmo dolls, Huang Tiange was tickling the ivories for several hours a day.

 The 10-year-old piano prodigy from China is making his New York City debut at Flushing Town Hall on Sunday, where he will dazzle audiences by playing Mozart’s music and one of his own compositions.

 “Flushing Town Hall prides itself on presenting global arts for a global community,” said Ellen Kodadek, executive and artistic director of the historic venue on Northern Blvd.

 “Huang Tiange is incredibly talented and poised, and we are proud to present him on our stage,” she said.

 During a rehearsal, the talented grade schooler performed the first movement of Mozart’s Sonata No. 10 K. 330 flawlessly.

 He also played a movement from his own Xinjiang Suite, which he wrote at the age of 6 to honor the Golden Season, or fall.

 Huang explained he drew from experiences traveling while writing the music.

 “I used my memory,” he said. “Instead of writing words, I use my music. Music is my language.”

 Huane will perform at Flushing Town Hall at 3 p.m. on Oct. 5.
