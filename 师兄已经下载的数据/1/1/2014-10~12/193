BEIJING, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng has met with an author from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who recently published a book introducing people from the northwestern region.
Yu, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, met with author Kurbanjan Semat as well as characters from his book "I come from Xinjiang" Wednesday.
"I come from Xinjiang" records over 100 ordinary people from Xinjiang with different ethnicities, professions and ages working in other parts of China, showcasing the general image of Xinjiang people working hard for their dreams.
Yu said the book was quite touching and recognized Xinjiang's contributions to the social and economic development of other parts of China with their hard work.
He called for strengthened exchanges between Xinjiang people and people from other parts of China, urging local governments to address the difficulties that Xinjiang people deal with in their work and livelihood in other parts of China.
Yu also called for strengthened work in education and employment in ethnic minority-inhabited areas in a bid to maintain social stability and ethnic unity in Xinjiang.
Labor-intensive industries and professional training of ethnic minorities should be promoted to enhance their ability in job seeking, he said.
