China jails students for Uighur ‘separatism’ - Updated News
Seven students of jailed Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti have been sentenced to up to eight years in prison on charges of separatism in China’s western Xinjiang region, two rights lawyers have said.
The verdict comes a day after at least eight people were given the death sentence for allegedly carrying out two deadly attacks in restive Xinjiang region.
Li Fangping, the lawyer who defended Tohti, said he was told by the students’ lawyer on Monday that they had been sentenced by the intermediate court in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi. Prosecutors had charged the students with “separatism”, Li said.
“Yesterday, we received information of [sentences] between three and eight years,” Li told Reuters news agency by telephone. “It’s unclear what condition they are in. It is also unclear if they will appeal.”
Liu Xiaoyuan, another lawyer who defended Tohti, confirmed the sentences, while a court official contacted about the case declined to comment.
In severe cases, charges of separatism in China are punishable by death.
Tohti, China’s most prominent advocate for the rights of Muslim Uighurs, lost his appeal against a life sentence for separatism last month.
