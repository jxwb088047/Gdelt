Xinjiang violence continues despite crackdown - The China Post
Information from the region is routinely suppressed so experts caution against any firm conclusions about the level of violence in the far western region that is home to 10 million members of the Muslim Uighur minority, who chafe under what they consider suppression by China's ethnic majority Han. However, both Chinese state-run media and foreign outlets who monitor Xinjiang have continued to report a stream of deadly clashes.
"It's safe to say that violence has continued roughly as it was before this latest crackdown, if not with greater intensity," said Rian Thum, an assistant professor specializing in Uighur history at Loyola University New Orleans.
Chinese state media outlets have reported at least 175 deaths in the past six months in eight violent incidents, including a massive attack on local government facilities that left 96 dead. That compares with 46 reported killed during the same period last year.
Rian Thum's own tally drawn from reports by the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia showed an even higher toll for the period, about 200 this year compared to roughly 50 the previous year.
Beijing blames the violence on separatist terrorists fueled by religious extremism and with ties abroad, and argues that it has invested generously to boost Xinjiang's economy and improve its quality of life. Critics attribute the violence to homegrown disgruntlement over local corruption and an influx of Hans who have brought economic development that has not equally benefited Uighurs.
