Death verdicts upheld in China train station attack | Asia-Pacific | Worldbulletin News
A Chinese court upheld Friday the death sentences handed to three people for their alleged links to an attack on a train station that left 31 people dead in March in southern Yunnan province.
Rejecting appeals, the Higher People's Court of Yunnan Province upheld the sentences ruled on last month by a lower court in provincial capital Kunming city, according to state news agency Xinhua.
On September 12, the Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced ethnic Uighurs Iskender Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasan Muhammad to death for organizing the knife attack and intentional homicide.
Another suspect, Patigul Tohti, was sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in the assault and intentional homicide.
Chinese authorities have called the March 1 incident, when a knife-wielding group of assailants left 31 people dead and 141 others wounded at Kunming’s railway station, a "terrorist attack."
Four of the attackers were shot dead by police, who detained the four sentenced suspects.
