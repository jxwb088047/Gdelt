12 sentenced to death in China for attack in Xinjiang - Newspaper - DAWN.COM
BEIJING: A Chinese court on Monday condemned 12 people to death and gave another 15 suspended death sentences in connection with a July attack in violence-racked Xinjiang, the regional government’s Tianshan portal said.
Thirty-seven civilians and 59 “terrorists” were killed and another 13 civilians wounded in the July 28 attack on a police station and government offices in Shache county, also known as Yarkand, according to state media.
The incident was the bloodiest in Xinjiang since rioting involving members of China’s Han majority and the mostly Muslim Uighur minority — the largest group in the region — left around 200 people dead in the capital Urumqi in 2009. The sentences bring the number of death sentences passed for Xinjiang-related violence to almost 40 since June, with 21 executions publicly announced.
“In adjudicating the case, the court fully implemented the criminal policy of combining justice with mercy,” Tianshan said.
In addition to the 15 given a suspended death sentence — normally commuted to life imprisonment, depending on the convict’s behaviour — nine people were sentenced to life in prison and 20 were given sentences ranging from four to 20 years, according to Tianshan.
