China Xinjiang violence kills 12 - Updated News
Clashes that killed 12 people in China’s western region of Xinjiang were caused by “terrorists”, Chinese state media report, citing police.
Six people were shot dead by police and six were killed in explosions in Xinjiang’s Aksu prefecture on Friday, state media said.
Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur minority group, sees sporadic clashes.
Verifying reports from the region is difficult because the information flow out of Xinjiang is tightly controlled.
Authorities traditionally blame extremists for outbreaks of violence, while Uighur activists point to tight Chinese control as a cause of tensions.
State-run news agency Xinhua said explosions took place at a hair salon and market on Friday afternoon.
After the blast, police shot six suspects, while another six died when they set off explosives, the news agency said, adding that five other people had been arrested.
Xinhua news agency described the incident as “organised, premeditated terrorist attacks”. But the report gave no reason why the hair salon and the market were targeted.
Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for exiled Uighur group the World Uighur Congress, suggested that the protests were sparked by anger at the salon because it was a front for a brothel.
“The forced repression and provocation is the real reason for the confrontation,” he said in a statement.
