China Knife Attack Leaves Six Dead
A knife attack in southern China has left six people dead, local officials have said.
Five people were hacked to death, and one person was fatally shot by police following a dispute at a market Friday in southern China, local authorities said.
The incident happened just two weeks after a deadly stabbing attack at a Chinese train station in the southwestern city of Kunming, raising concerns the latest scenes of violence were ethnically motived.
The earlier March 1 knife attack that killed 29 and wounded more than 140 at a train station in Nanjing was blamed by the Chinese Government on Xinjiang separatists, believed to be members of the Turkish-speaking Muslim Uighur minority from the region.
The latest attack apparently erupted from a dispute between two vendors who were apparently Uighurs selling ethnic foods. The knife fight apparently left one of the vendors dead, police in Changsha said in an online statement.
The other fled and savagely stabbed four more people while on the run before he was shot dead by police, police said.
