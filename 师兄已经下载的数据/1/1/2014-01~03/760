Religious extremists behind Friday's Xinjiang attack, Beijing says: Shanghaiist
Officials in Beijing say that religious extremists were behind the latest 'terrorist attack' in Xinjiang on Friday that left 11 people dead and four more injured.
Investigations showed that the clash in Wushi county, in which a group of assailants riding motorbikes and cars launched an attack on police forces, was an "organized, premeditated terrorist assault targeting the police," according to Xinhua, citing police in Xinjiang.
Eight of the assailants were shot dead at the scene and one was apprehended by police, according to reports.
Previously, conclusive evidence led to police detaining Ilham Tohti, an Uyghur economist at Beijing's Minzu University, for his alleged involvement in a series of attacks in Xinjiang.
Police told reporters that he used his authoritative status to influence others overseas and helped organize sending people abroad to carry out separatist activities.
