TIP leader vows revenge on China - Global Times
Hidden in secret mountain bases on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, Uyghur extremists are gearing up for retribution against China to avenge the deaths of "comrades" in strikes on terrorists by Chinese government, their leader told Reuters.In a rare but brief interview, Abdullah Mansour, leader of the rebel Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), said it was his holy duty to fight against China."China is not only our enemy, but it is the enemy of all Muslims ... We have plans for many attacks in China," he said, speaking in the Uyghur language through an interpreter.Li Wei, a Chinese anti-terrorism expert, told the Global Times that it is no surprise that "this terrorist" has come out again with the purpose of promoting his popularity and advertising his intentions via international media. After the terrorist attack at Jinshui Bridge in Tiananmen Square, "this man" also came out and "claimed responsibility" for the attack, hoping to increase the atmosphere of terror in society, said Li.Reuters - Global Times
