Xinjiang governor pledges terrorism crackdown - Xinhua | English.news.cn
URUMQI, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Thursday vowed to crack down on terrorism, as maintaining social stability is a priority for 2014.
"The regional government will resolutely crack down on religious extremism, prevent violent terrorist attacks and mass incidents from happening," said Nur Bekri, chairman of the regional government.
The official told the second session of the 12th regional People's Congress that the government will continue combating the "three evil forces" of terrorism, separatism and extremism.
However, the battle is still chronic, complicated and severe, he warned.
He said that the government will continue carrying out ethnic unity campaigns because safeguarding unity will fundamentally guarantee the region's long-term social stability.
In addition, the regional government will strengthen community services and improve the residence permit system to serve people better, said Nur Bekri.
