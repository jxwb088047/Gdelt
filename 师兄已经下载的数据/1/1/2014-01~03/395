Iranian Parliament's Foreign Policy Spokesman Claims US Kidnapped Malaysian Plane | Frontpage Mag
I don't know why it wasn't Israel. Maybe Iran no longer thinks that Israel's plane-napping skills are up to par
Call off the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, an Iranian lawmaker has solved the mystery.
The United States “kidnapped” the airliner as part of a conspiracy to “sabotage the relationship between Iran and China and Southeast Asia,” parliamentarian Hossein Naghavi Hosseini said, according to a translation by The New York Times.
The parliamentarian, Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, who is the spokesman for the foreign policy committee, responded to the news on Tuesday that two Iranian nationals had been traveling on the missing flight holding stolen passports.
The fact that two Iranians were traveling on the plane using stolen passports was part of “the plot,” Hosseini reportedly said.
Iran doesn't need the US to do that. Iran's bomb plot in Thailand and its support for Islamic Rohingya terror in Burma and Uyghur Islamic terror in China.
Senior Iranian clerics like Ayatollah Nasser Makarem Shirazi and Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani have condemned the recent killings of Muslims in China and asked the Foreign Ministry to seriously pursue the issue.
During the meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister's Special envoy to Iran, Hossein Sheikh al-Islam reminded the Iranian clerics' sensitivity to the recent events in Xinjiang, and urged China to respect Muslims' rights in the region and provide proper conditions for the Muslims to hold their religious ceremonies.
Clearly it's America's fault that Iran can't stop clinging to its terrorists.
