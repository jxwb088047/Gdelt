More than a dozen dead after stampede at Chinese mosque: State media
At least 14 people were killed and 10 others hurt in a stampede during a gathering at a mosque in northwest China on Sunday, state media reported.
The deadly stampede happened just after 1 p.m. local time Sunday as food was being distributed at an event commemorating a prominent religious figure, according to the Xinhua news agency.
An investigation is underway to determine what sparked the incident at the mosque in the town of Xiji in the Ningxia region, the agency reported Monday.
