Brad Adams, perhaps you want to take these economic illegal immigrants to your home country. Problem is most western propagates of human right like you are only offering lip service ,and non dare to urge their own countries to accept these immigrants. Western hypocricy.

My advise is that if Uygurs like to stay peacefully in China, do not be involved in terrorist and extreme behaviours. After all they are living in Chinese territorie and subject to their rules.
The Chinese fears separatist and terrorist movements of Uyghurs. Any violent acts by Uyghurs will worsen the situations. Religion and race is a problem everywhere. Immigration is a way out to survive.
