TV stations suspended for 20-minute ads - Chinadaily.com.cn
Two satellite TV stations have been suspended from broadcasting commercial advertisements because they violated State regulations on the length of broadcasted advertisements.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps TV will be suspended from broadcasting ads for 15 days from Jan 9 to 24, and Sichuan TV will be suspended from broadcasting ads for seven days from Jan 9 to 16.
The suspensions were imposed because the companies violated a regulation that took effect on Jan 1, which bans shopping advertisements longer than three minutes, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television announced on its website.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps TV broadcasted two shopping advertisements longer than 20 minutes, and Sichuan TV broadcasted one shopping advertisement longer than 20 minutes as of early on Monday, according to the administrationâ€™s announcement.
