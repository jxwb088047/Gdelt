 Special Report: 2014 NPC & CPPCC Sessions | 


The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Northwest China will carry even stronger measures to fight against terrorism, separatism and religious extremism. Stability is the top priority. The statements come from the Xinjiang Party Secretary at an open session at the National People’s Congress. Violent terrorist attacks have been increasing since 2009, and pose the biggest security threat to Xinjiang.
The media spotlight is on Xinjiang’s Party Secretary Zhang Chunxian.
Zhang says the rising terrorist actions are not the result of tightened control; rather, it’s the global spread of religious extremism.
Zhang Chunxian, party secretary of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said, "Development and tightening the fight against extremism and terrorism are not contradictory. To the terrorists, we will give a stronger fight, but that does not mean we have to sacrifice development for security. Both are the crucially important for Xinjiang’s stability and growth."
Last October, Tiananmen, an icon in the heart of Beijing, was the target. And last week, it was the Kunming railway station in the southwestern province of Yunnan.
Nur Bekri, chairman of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said,“The terrorists do not represent any ethnic group or religion. They have challenged minimum standards of civilized society and humans. The people of Xinjiang have strongly condemned all kinds of terrorist actions.”
Xinjiang has a large population, with the Uygurs being the largest ethnic minority.
It has strategic importance on China’s western frontier, and rich natural resources. It’s also one of the least developed regions in the country.
Xinjiang has been at the country’s forefront against terrorism. Violent attacks have erupted periodically across the vast region.
The central government has long been investing hugely in the region to improve living standards and building mosques to support religious practice. But threats to security seem to grow.
At Thursday’s briefing, Xinjiang authorities promised no tolerance for any form of terrorism, separatism and extremism. They put stability as their top priority.
Given that the terrorist attacks have gone beyond Xinjiang and are targeting civilians, this fight will be a long-term struggle.
