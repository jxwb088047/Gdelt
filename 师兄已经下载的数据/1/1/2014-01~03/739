Missing professor returns from China | The Japan Times
KOBE – A Chinese professor at Kobe University who had been missing since traveling to China earlier this month has arrived back in Japan, a university official said Tuesday.
Wang Ke, a professor of modern Chinese political thought at the university’s Graduate School of Intercultural Studies, arrived at Kansai International Airport around 8:30 p.m. Monday, according to the official.
Kobe University said it would hold a news conference after meeting from Wang, who also focuses on ethnic minorities in China, including the Uighurs.
The researcher left home March 1 for a 10-day trip to China but called March 10 to tell his family in Japan he would stay for around 10 more days to visit his mother in Xian, central China, who he said had fallen ill. However, the mother said when contacted by the family that she was fine and that Wang had not visited her.
