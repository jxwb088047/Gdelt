China charges 4 suspects in Kunming knife attack: Shanghaiist
China has set out charges against the four surviving suspects in the March 1 Kunming stabbing spree that left 29 people dead and around 140 injured, according to People's Daily.
The charges against suspects in the attack include organizing, leading and participating in a terrorist organization and murder, Reuters reports, adding that the suspects are likely to be given a death penalty based on the severity of the crimes.
The attack happened around 9 p.m. at the Kunming Railway station, when masked assailants carrying knives rushed in and began slashing commuters indiscriminately.
Police rushed to the scene and shot four of the attackers dead, and devious reports say that two men and two women were arrested in connection to the stabbings a few days later.
State media described the stabbing spree as an "organized terrorist attack" carried out by Xinjiang separatists.
More than 100 people, including policemen, have been killed in a string of violent attacks carried out in the troubled Xinjiang region since last April.
