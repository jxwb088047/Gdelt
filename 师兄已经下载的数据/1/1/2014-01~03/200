People in western China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also celebrated the new year in the capital Urumqi. The festivities come after a tumultuous year, which saw a string of terrorist attacks. Just a day before New Year’s Eve, nine terrorist suspects assaulted a public security bureau near the border town of Kashgar. As Han Peng reports, people in Xinjiang are now hoping for a peaceful 2014.
Using social media, a New Year’s Carnival was organized in downtown Urumqi.
Fashion and passion have torn down all the ethnic barriers. Uyghur and Han peoples perform together on the same stage.
As for the young Islamic women, they seem to be more Westernized than many outsiders think.
They say they are proud of their faith and ethnicity, but they are also eager to mingle with the rest of the world.
Li Wanhui, Network Coordination Director of Xinjiang Internet Information Office, said, "We have gathered young people of all ethnic groups. Whether they are Uyghur, Han, or any other ethnicity... they define the real Xinjiang by love and tolerance. And they are wishing for an even better 2014. They are the embodiment of ethnic unity."
The year 2013 is by no means a perfect year for Xinjiang. Actually the region has seen a continued rise in terrorist threat. But that doesn’t seem to have affected the festivities of the New Year Countdown. Across the region, people are hoping for a better, safer and more stable year, in which they can continue to enjoy the fruit of ethnic unity and development. This is Han Peng reporting. Happy New Year from Urumqi, Xinjiang!
