Terrorist Attack in Missing Malaysian Airline? | Guardian Liberty Voice
The question still remains whether missing Malaysia Flight MH 370 was a terrorist attack. Its is now over 24 hours since Flight MH 370 disappeared with 239 passengers over the South China Sea between Malaysia and China. Aviation safety experts have been exploring since Saturday whether Flight MH 370 may have fallen victim to a terrorist attack. The only clue now known to authorities is that two passengers had boarded the flight with stolen passports. Aviation experts have also found it incomprehensible that a distress call was not made. Flight MH 370 was cruising at 35,000 feet when it lost contact with air traffic controllers.
Air and sea rescue teams in the South China Sea have located two oil slicks in the vicinity where Flight BH 370 lost contact with air traffic controllers. The rescue mission that was carried out by five countries found no survivors or wreckage of the Boeing 777. The oil slicks were spotted off the coast of Vietnam and were said to be six to ten miles long. There has been no official confirmation that the oil slicks were that of the missing Boeing 777.
The mystery surrounding the disappearance of Flight MH 370 comes just one week after 29 people were killed and 130 injured in what Chinese authorities have described as a terrorist attack. Ten men with long knives attacked the railroad station in the city of Kunming in what Chinese authorities describe as a slaughter. The Chinese have identified attackers as militants from the China’s Uighur Muslim minority. A Malaysian government official said that they have not ruled out Uighur militants in the disappearance of Flight MH 370.  He further added that Uighurs were deported from Malaysia in 2011 and 2012 for using falsified passports.
It is now been reported that the missing Malaysia Boeing 777 was involved in an aviation accident in August 2012 when it collided with another aircraft and broke its wing tip.  The Boeing 777 which is also known as the “triple seven” is the world’s largest twin jet with a seating capacity from 314 to 451 passengers. The Boeing 777 was first placed in service in June 1995. Aviation safety experts describe the Boeing 777 as one of the safest aircraft in service today. The Boeing 777 had only one fatal crash in 18 years of service when Asiana Flight 214 crashed on July 13, 2013 in San Francisco in a flight from South Korea. Three passengers died and 181 were injured.
The disappearance of Flight MH 370 is an eerie reminder of Air France Flight 447 that crashed on June 1, 2009. All 228 passengers were killed. It disappeared for hours and only two days later the wreckage was found. Ultimately pilot error was determined as the cause of the crash.
John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that since there was no Mayday or distress signal it strongly suggests an “explosive decompression or explosive.”
Was it a terrorist attack that brought down Flight MH 370 or was it possibly pilot error such as in the case of Air France Flight 447. It may take weeks or possibly months for aviation experts to determine the cause of the crash.
