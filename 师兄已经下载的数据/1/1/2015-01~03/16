Fox News Reacts To Ferguson Shooting - Blame Obama?
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 12, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur, John Iadaola, Jimmy Dore, and Ben Mankiewicz of The Young Turks discuss the reactions by Fox News and others to the recent police shooting in Ferguson, Michigan.
Fox News became the scene of a heated debate when Kristen Powers and Andrea Tantaros got into a heated debate over the Ferguson, Michigan shootings against police officers. Tantaros blamed Obama, claiming that the Department of Justice and the Obama Administration were to blame for emboldening the people of Ferguson to fire weapons at police officers. Powers countered that there were shootings against cops before Obama and there likely would be after. This debate was started by Ferguson’s Police Chief retiring recently over reports of racism in the Police Department.
The unrest in Ferguson continues, sparked by the killing of Michael Brown when he assaulted Officer Darren Wilson.”
