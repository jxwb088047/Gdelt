Detroit: A City Of Fire And Ice
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMarch 5, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the recent trip some of the TYT team and he took to the struggling city of Detroit.
Among the many things that Cenk and the gang encounter included burnt out homes, long deserted factories and ruined husks of once great public structures. The city that gave us the automobile is slowly trying to recover from the blight and financial problems that have plagued the once thriving center of American industry for decades. But not all was darkness and ruin. There is also a strong and dedicated group of avid viewers of the TYT network as well as a growing attempt to repair the once great city.”
