FACTBOX-Chinese quasi-military group is top cotton producer
Feb 20 (Reuters) - China's Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a quasi-military group created 60 years ago to settle the restive far west region of Xinjiang, has become the country's top cotton producer.
Also known as the army corps, or 'bingtuan', the group has a strong influence on the local economy and has resisted government efforts to bring in market-driven cotton prices, trade sources say.
* The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) was created in 1954 and initially made up of demobilised soldiers, who spent part of their time in military training and the rest turning the region's arid land into farms.
* Civilian members from eastern China later joined the corps and it now numbers 2.7 million people, or almost 12 percent of the region's population. It is almost entirely made up of Han Chinese in a region that is home to the Muslim Uighur people.
* The group is like a "state within a state", say experts, and has established new cities in the region with schools and universities and jurisdiction over police and courts.
* It accounted for more than 17 percent of Xinjiang's GDP in 2013, or 148 billion yuan ($23.67 billion), thanks to its role in industries such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, chemicals and coal. It has several subsidiaries listed on mainland exchanges.
* The group controls 70,600 square km (27,300 square miles), an area bigger than the Netherlands and Belgium combined. This includes 1.24 million hectares of farmland where it grows cotton, grapes, tomatoes and other crops. Its farms are positioned at the headwaters of Xinjiang's major rivers, says Australia National University scholar Tom Cliff, meaning it has effective control over the region's water resources.
* Bingtuan cotton is reputed to be the best quality fibre in China. As many as 200,000 people work in cotton for the group, covering 60 percent of its farmland, according to its vice commander Kong Xingling.
* The group no longer has direct ties to the army but has significant influence and a cabinet paper last year said the group continued to play a big role in promoting "unity among ethnic groups and maintaining social stability".
* Employment discrimination, experts say, along with a demographic shift that many Uighurs feel is diluting their culture, is fuelling resentment that spills over into violent attacks directed at Han Chinese, China's majority ethnic group.
* China denies that Uighurs are unfairly marginalized, and says it is addressing underdevelopment and lack of jobs in heavily Uighur areas. ($1 = 6.2535 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Ed Davies)
