Chinese police shoot 2 dead near Vietnam border
Suspects identified as ‘Xinjiang ethnics’ allegedly resisted arrest, attacking police with knives
BEIJING - Chinese police have shot dead two people suspected of trying to cross the southern Guangxi region’s border into Vietnam, state media reported Monday.
The China Daily cited local authorities as saying a group of five people were spotted by police at around 8.20 p.m. (1220GMT) Sunday and resisted arrest in Pingxiang city.
The suspects allegedly attacked the police with knives, and were identified as “Xinjiang ethnics” -- a phrase often used to refer to members of the Uighur Muslim minority.
While two suspects were shot dead and two others taken into custody, local police said a manhunt has been launched for the fifth person.
Wide security measures were introduced in the troubled Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in 2014 to combat attacks and clashes with security forces by separatists who are fighting to create an independent East Turkestan nation.
Uighur, a Turkic group that makes up around 45 percent of the population of Xinjiang, has accused China of carrying out repressive policies that restrain their religious, commercial and cultural activities.
