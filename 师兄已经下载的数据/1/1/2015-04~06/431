In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 3, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the changes made to the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Changes have been handed down on April 2nd for changes to Indiana’s Religious Freedom Law that had faced national outcry due to its anti-LGBT stance that allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone based on religious grounds. The new changes go out of their way to make sure that no one can be discriminated against for sexual orientation or gender identity. While these changes do circumvent the original purpose the entire law it still leaves in the possibility that religious persons could be discriminated against if this were not already protected under a different set of laws.”
Were these changes to Indiana’s Religious Freedom Law enough? Let us know in the comments section below.
