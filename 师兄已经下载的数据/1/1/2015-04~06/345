As part of an ongoing military operation against Somali terror group al-Shabaab, Kenyan fighter jets conducted airstrikes in Somalia on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning.

The fighter jets dropped bombs on two al-Shabaab training camps in Somalia. Kenyan military sources say that both camps have been completely destroyed. 

The al-Shabaab training camps are located just 200 kilometres from the Kenyan-Somali border, and halfway between the border and the Somali town of Bardera. 

Al-Shabaab militants deny the bombs hit their training camps and claim the airstrikes only impacted farmland and livestock in the area. 

Last week’s massacre at Kenya’s Garissa University College highlights Kenya’s ongoing struggle to protect itself against the repercussions of a lawless Somalia. Somalia’s al Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militants often stage violent attacks across the 700-kilometre, porous border between Kenya and Somalia.

CNN reports that according to a Kenyan military source, the airstrikes were not launched in retaliation for the Kenyan university attack week.

The Garissa University College has opened its doors nine months after the deadliest terror attack that left at least 148 people dead and over 60 others injured.

The university, which is the first and only in Kenya’s northern frontier, reopened nine months after the attack by the Islamist militants linked to the Al Shabaab terror group.

Most of staff members have already reported to work while students and the academic staff are expected back on Monday, January 4th, 2016.

In what has been seen as bolstering of security at the university, a police post has been set up in the campus and a thorough security check is being conducted at the entrance.
