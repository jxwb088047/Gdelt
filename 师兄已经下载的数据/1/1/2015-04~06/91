A welcome cool down from the hot weather. China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region got a rare glimpse of summer snowfall last Sunday after a powerful cold air front moved into the mountainous areas of Hami and Altay. The snow painted the mountain white and turned the usually desert landscape into a winter wonderland.
Celebrating Children’s Day in a big way. A pair of giant pandas, Kai Kai and Xin Xin, whose names in Chinese, together, mean “Happiness”, made their debut on Monday in Macau, receiving a warm welcome from locals. The cuddly couple were promised by China’s central government as a gift to Macau during President Xi Jinping’s last visit in December.
Also on Children’s Day, the Du Fu Thatched cottage museum in southwest Sichuan province invited local primary school students to celebrate the special day in style. Students were given a chance to dress up in ancient costumes worn during the time of Du Fu, the great Tang Dynasty romantic poet. They were then tasked with reading poems and guiding small tours for the public, bringing back to life China's traditional culture.
