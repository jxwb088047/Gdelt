Officers force her to the ground.

After another minute and a half, she\'s placed in the back of a police car, her family says she was handcuffed.

Cleveland police Wednesday released the surveillance video capturing the shooting of a 12-year-old Cleveland youth by police.

Tamir Rice was shot to death Saturday by Cleveland police, who responded to a call identifying someone \"waving a gun\" around outside Cudell Recreation Center.

Timothy Loehmann , 26, and Frank Garmback, 46 , were the officers involved in the shooting. Loehmann fired the fatal shot.

\"Keep in mind, the incident involved a 12-year-old boy,\" Police Chief Calvin Williams said.

At first, Tamir\'s family didn\'t want to watch or have the video and audio released, but later changed their minds. Tamir\'s family and police agreed to release the video Wednesday afternoon. 

The video shows Tamir sitting at a picnic table and getting up, pointing and waving a gun. Commander Ed Tomba said officers told Tamir three times to put his hands up through an open car door as they pulled up to the scene.

Mostly lost in the Democratic and Republican primary contests last night, there were other races that deserve attention. Two of the prosecutors involved in some of the most high-profile cases of police brutality in recent years have lost their primary re-election battles. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

“On Tuesday night, two major Midwestern prosecutors lost their jobs after provoking nationwide rage with their handling of cases in which police officers killed unarmed young black people. In Illinois, the loser was Cook County state’s attorney Anita Alvarez, who waited 13 months to bring charges against the Chicago police officer who shot Laquan McDonald 16 times in October 2014. In Ohio, it was Cuyahoga County district attorney Tim McGinty, who oversaw grand jury proceedings that led to no charges being filed against the officers responsible for the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.

Together the two results represent a major victory for the Black Lives Matter movement, whose organizers have now decisively demonstrated their ability to mobilize voters and change the direction of local politics. And while these two races were, technically, only Democratic primaries, the two candidates who won them are expected to take office with minimal or nonexistent opposition after the fall’s general election.”*

Tamir Rice was shot dead in two seconds in Ohio. He was twelve and had a toy gun. A grand jury in Ohio has decided not to press any charges against the officer who killed him. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"An Ohio grand jury has declined to indict the Cleveland police officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice, an unarmed black 12-year-old, in 2014.

Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty announced the decision Monday afternoon, 401 days after rookie patrolman Timothy Loehmann shot Rice at a park in Cleveland. The grand jury also declined to indict veteran officer Frank Garmback, who responded to the scene with Loehmann, on charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty.

Tamir’s family criticized the grand jury decision and in a statement accused McGinty of \"abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment.””*

\"The president of the Cleveland Patrolmen\'s Association on Monday refused to back down from criticizing a Cleveland Browns player as \"pathetic\" for wearing a shirt calling for justice for two unarmed black males who were killed by police officers in Ohio.

Cleveland Patrolmen\'s Association President Jeffrey Follmer on Sunday issued a statement criticizing Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins for wearing a shirt saying, \"Justice For Tamir Rice and John Crawford,\" before the team\'s game. Tamir Rice, 12, was shot to death by Cleveland police last month while carrying a pellet gun. Crawford, 22, was killed by police officers in August while holding a toy rifle in a Walmart in Dayton, Ohio.

\"It\'s pretty pathetic when athletes think they know the law,\" Follmer said on Sunday. \"They should stick to what they know best on the field. The Cleveland Police protect and serve the Browns stadium and the Browns organization owes us an apology.\"

After Hawkins explained on Monday that he wore the shirt thinking of what could happen to his 2-year-old son, Follmer refused to back down.\"* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

The status message, entitled “Kids will be Kids?” was posted to the Fenton police department’s Facebook page.

Fenton is near Ferguson and also a part of St. Louis County. The status post didn’t focus on the actions of the officer in the Rice shooting but instead directed its attention to the role children may play.\"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

BAN CLEVELAND! Adding insult to homicide, the City of Cleveland has decided to sue the family of Tamir Rice in order to get money for an ambulance bill. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks breaks down this infuriating story. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"The City of Cleveland has devastated the family of Tamir Rice several times over, and seems to have no intention of stopping. This afternoon in probate court, Cleveland Scene reports, the city filed a creditor’s claim for $500, saying that Rice’s family still owes them for the ambulance and paramedics that tended to the 12-year-old’s body after he was shot by a police officer in November 2014.

In the language of the notice, the city states that the Rice family is responsible “for emergency medical services rendered as the decedent’s last dying expense under Ohio Revised Code.” Broken down, the city is billing Rice’s family $450 for “advance life support” that did not save him and $50 for the mileage driven by the ambulance to the hospital where he died.”*

\"The City of Cleveland has devastated the family of Tamir Rice several times over, and seems to have no intention of stopping. This afternoon in probate court, Cleveland Scene reports, the city filed a creditor’s claim for $500, saying that Rice’s family still owes them for the ambulance and paramedics that tended to the 12-year-old’s body after he was shot by a police officer in November 2014.

In the language of the notice, the city states that the Rice family is responsible “for emergency medical services rendered as the decedent’s last dying expense under Ohio Revised Code.” Broken down, the city is billing Rice’s family $450 for “advance life support” that did not save him and $50 for the mileage driven by the ambulance to the hospital where he died.”*

http://www.vladtv.com - Rapper Immortal Technique stopped by the VladTV offices and shared his thoughts on the current state of racial affairs in the US and reacts to the news of 12-year-old African-American Tamir Rice being killed by police just seconds after they arrived on the scene.
Tech reminds us that incidents like this, Mike Brown, and others almost always happen in poor African-American and Latino communities, saying that the U.S. justice system is only built for a certain people, with both class and race being factors. However, he also feels that that can no longer be the case as people of color are demanding fair treatment. Check out the clip above....
