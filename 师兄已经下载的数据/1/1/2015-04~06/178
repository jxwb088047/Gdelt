The International Criminal Court (ICC) held a ceremony on 1 April 2015 at the seat of the Court in The Hague (the Netherlands) to welcome the State of Palestine as the 123rd State Party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty.

During the ceremony, the ICC’s Second Vice-President, Judge Kuniko Ozaki, presented the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Palestine, Dr. Riad Al-Malki, with a special edition of the Rome Statute, as a symbol of their joint commitment to the rule of law. 

The ceremony was held in the presence of the President of the Assembly of States Parties, H.E. Sidiki Kaba, a number of ICC Judges, ICC Deputy Prosecutor James Stewart and ICC Registrar Herman von Hebel.

Vice-President Kuniko Ozaki stated: “Accession to a treaty is, of course, just the first step. As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly.”

The President of the Assembly of States Parties, H.E. Sidiki Kaba, declared that “such highly symbolic commitment confirms, once again, that people all over the world embrace the noble ideals of the ICC, that are ideals of peace and justice for all.” 

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Palestine Dr. Riad Al-Malki said: “As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice. Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.”...

The Palestinian mission to the United Nations says Foreign Minister Riyad Maliki is going to file a lawsuit against Israel at the International Criminal Court on Monday. 

The lawsuit is related to recent arson attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinian people and property. The move comes in the wake of the torching of a Palestinian home in the occupied West Bank on Friday that left a baby dead and hospitalized his family. Evidence of Israeli settlers’ attack on an ancient Christian church in Tabgha, near Tiberias is also included in the file. Senior Palestinian sources say the lawsuit will seek to prove that the attacks by extremist settlers aren\'t sporadic hate crimes as declared by Israeli officials, BUT are premeditated and follow a set pattern.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged the International Criminal Court to reject the Palestinians\' request to join the Hague-based body.

Netanyahu described the Palestinian membership request as hypocritical. He said the Palestinian Authority is not a state but an entity linked to a terrorist organization. Netanyahu\'s remarks come one day after Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas signed the request for ICC membership. The move could pave the way for the Palestinians to sue Israeli officials over war crimes. The United States has also strongly opposed the bid, calling it counter-productive. The Palestinians\' push to join international bodies follows an upgrade of their UN rank from observer entity to observer state in 2012.

The International Criminal Court has opened a preliminary investigation into war crimes on Palestinian territories. The announcement drew an angry reaction from Israel. 

ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has said the preliminary examination will be conducted with full independence and impartiality. The move could pave the way for a full investigation into possible war crimes. Israel\'s Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman condemned the move as scandalous, adding its main purpose is to try to harm Israel\'s right to defend itself from terror. The ICC announcement comes only days after the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced that the Palestinian authority will become a member of the ICC as of April 1st. Mahmoud Abbas has pledged to pursue war crimes charges against Israel for killing Palestinians during its wars on Gaza and violations in occupied territories.

Palestinian members of the Israeli Knesset say the recent U-N report on Tel Aviv’s latest war on Gaza has provided enough evidence for the prosecution of Israeli officials at The Hague.
Palestinian M-Ks say the facts in the report confirm that Gaza suffered disproportionately greater casualties and destruction during the 50-day war last summer. They insist that Israeli authorities should be sued in the International Criminal Court. The report by the U-N Commission of Inquiry accuses both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes, but lays most of the blame on Tel Aviv. Now, the Human Rights Council is set to debate the report in coming few days in Geneva. The U-N General Assembly is also expected to call for the implementation of the report and send it to the Security Council.

The Palestinian Authority is going to file a complaint against Israel at the International Criminal Court over the unlawful fatal shootings of Palestinian youngsters.
The PA has described the Israeli army’s killing of Palestinians as a field execution without any trial. The Palestinian Authority added that the practice is an implementation of Israel’s policy of triggering incitement. It also accused Tel Aviv of giving a green light to its forces to kill Palestinians in cold blood instead of arresting them. The Authority said it won\'t remain silent over the daily killings and called on the international community to protect the Palestinian youth. On Saturday, Israeli troops shot dead a 16-year-old teenager after he stabbed a soldier in the south of the West Bank. Another young man was also shot and critically wounded near Ramallah.

The Palestinian government is pressing ahead with its efforts to bring war crimes charges against Israel in the Hague.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Riyad al-Maliki says two lawsuits would be submitted to the International Criminal Court on June 25. He says the files are over Israel’s illegal settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and its latest devastating war on the besieged Gaza Strip. Tel Aviv’s offensive last summer left over two-thousand Palestinians dead and thousands of others injured. Israel and its ally, the United States, have threatened to do all they can to combat proceedings against Tel Aviv. Palestinians formally became a member of the ICC on April the first.

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the early 20th century. The conflict is wide-ranging, and the term is also used in reference to the earlier phases of the same conflict, between the Zionist yishuv and the Arab population living in Palestine under Ottoman and then British rule. It forms part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. The remaining key issues are: mutual recognition, borders, security, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements,Palestinian freedom of movement and legalities concerning refugees. The violence resulting from the conflict has prompted international actions, as well as other security and human rights concerns, both within and between both sides, and internationally. In addition, the violence has curbed expansion of tourism in the region, which is full of historic and religious sites that are of interest to many people around the world.
Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside an independent Jewish state or next to the State of Israel (after Israel's establishment in 1948). As recently as 2007, a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, prefer the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict. Moreover, a considerable majority of the Jewish public sees the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state. A majority of Palestinians and Israelis view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an acceptable location of the hypothetical Palestinian state in a two-state solution. However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments.
