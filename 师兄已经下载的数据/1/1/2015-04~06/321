What The Iran/U.S. Nuclear Framework Deal Means
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiApril 3, 2015Leave a Comment
“Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the new nuclear deal between the United States and Iran.
Nuclear negotiations have finally been outlined by Iran and the United States and its allies. President Barack Obama went as far as to say ‘if Iran cheats, the world will know’. Iran has agreed not to stockpile weapons grade nuclear materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons and in exchange the U.S. and others have agreed to lift sanctions. Secretary of State John Kerry went on to add that the international community would need proof from Iran that it would uphold its end of the deal or sanctions would not be lifted. While nothing is official until the deal is signed the framework is a major step forward in the nuclear talks.
The final draft of the deal is due with a deadline of June 30th.”
Is this enough of a deal with Iran or should there have been more? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.
