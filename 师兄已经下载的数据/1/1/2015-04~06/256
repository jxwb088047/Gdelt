Xinjiang's natural gas output expected to hit 30 bln cubic meters - Xinhua | English.news.cn
URUMQI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is expected to produce 30.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas this year, according to statistics from the region's four gas producers.
The figure is more than 30,000 times that of the region's gas output 60 years ago, according to data from the regional statistical bureau.
Boasting three major gas-rich basins - Tarim, Junggar and Tuha - Xinjiang began feverishly developing the region's gas exploitation in 2004 after a large project started bringing gas from Xinjiang to the booming eastern regions.
In 2005, Xinjiang yielded 10.6 billion cubic meters of gas. The number soared to 29.6 billion last year, accounting for 23.5 percent of the country's total output.
The clean energy has also been used within the region to boost the economy and curb pollution.
Resource assessment shows the region has 14 trillion cubic meters of natural gas and 22.8 billion tonnes of oil.
