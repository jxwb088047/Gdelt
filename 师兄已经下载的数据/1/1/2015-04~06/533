Uyghurs documentary to screen in Bermuda | The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News
A documentary focusing on Uyghurs who were imprisoned in the notorious Guantánamo Bay facility is set to be screened this weekend in Bermuda.
Uyghurs: Prisoners of the Absurd, directed by filmmaker Patricio Henriquez, follows 22 Chinese Muslims captured in Afghanistan and held for years despite being cleared of all charges. One of the men featured  Khalil Mamut  was one of four Uyghurs who were sent to Bermuda. The documentary touches on how the decision came about, using interviews with US diplomat Daniel Fried.
The film, which premiered last year in Canada and has since been screened in London and New York as part of the Human Rights Watch Travelling Film Festival, is now going to be featured as part of the Weekend Film Series at the Tradewinds Auditorium in the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute. Screening will be on Sunday.
Tickets cost $15, and are available at Oceans Gift Shop, BUEI or reserve by calling 294-0204.
