A series of bloody attacks has rocked Kenya since the September 2013 Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi that left 67 people dead. Curiously, some recent victims in these attacks have been Muslim sheiks that were associated with al Shabaab, the jihadi group that took credit for the deadly Westgate attack. Even more curiously, all of the high-profile sheik murders have taken place in the same area in Mombasa, Kenya\'s second largest city.

VICE News headed to Mombasa to speak with Abubaker Shariff Ahmed, the highest profile radical sheik in Kenya, before he was assassinated in April, and to get a close-up view of those living and dying in the crosshairs of a holy war being fought on Kenya\'s streets.

As part of an ongoing military operation against Somali terror group al-Shabaab, Kenyan fighter jets conducted airstrikes in Somalia on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning.

The fighter jets dropped bombs on two al-Shabaab training camps in Somalia. Kenyan military sources say that both camps have been completely destroyed. 

The al-Shabaab training camps are located just 200 kilometres from the Kenyan-Somali border, and halfway between the border and the Somali town of Bardera. 

Al-Shabaab militants deny the bombs hit their training camps and claim the airstrikes only impacted farmland and livestock in the area. 

Last week’s massacre at Kenya’s Garissa University College highlights Kenya’s ongoing struggle to protect itself against the repercussions of a lawless Somalia. Somalia’s al Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militants often stage violent attacks across the 700-kilometre, porous border between Kenya and Somalia.

CNN reports that according to a Kenyan military source, the airstrikes were not launched in retaliation for the Kenyan university attack week.

\"Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the Al-Shabaab attack on a Kenya university that left one hundred and forty-seven dead.

Al-Shabaab gunmen attacked the Garissa University College in northeastern Kenya taking hostages and killing non-Muslims. Witnesses reported seeing the gunmen in combat gear with some wearing bullet proof vests or suicide vests. A firefight with Kenyan security forces killed the gunmen but when the smoke cleared the body count stood at 147. 

Al-Shabaab is an extremist group from Somalia with close ties to Al Qaeda. It claimed that it had started the attack as an \'operation against the infidels\'.\" 

What can be done to prevent these kind of attacks in the future? Let us know in the comments section below.

Last weeks attack on the Kenyan military base in Somalia will go down as the worst in the history of the Kenya Defense Forces. 

So far, there have been no official figures on how many soldiers were killed, though unconfirmed reports indicate the casualty numbers could be in double or triple figures.

Details of the attack reveal a shift in how the militants engaged the Kenya Defence Forces, in both numbers and tactics.

Today, the Kenya Defence Forces gave a detailed account of what happened on that fateful day, as search and rescue operations continue, 6 days after the attack. Dennis Okari takes up that story.
