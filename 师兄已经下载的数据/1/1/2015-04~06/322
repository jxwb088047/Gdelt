BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - China has cracked down on 181
"terror gangs" in its restive far western region of Xinjiang,
which has suffered a string of violent attacks, state media
reported on Monday.
Resource-rich Xinjiang, strategically located on the borders
of central Asia, plays a crucial rule in helping China meet its
growing energy needs.
The campaign kicked off after 39 people were killed in a
suicide bombing at a market in the regional capital of Urumqi
last May, official news agency Xinhua said, citing data from the
regional committee of the ruling Communist Party.
Police in Xinjiang busted the gangs, Xinhua reported, adding
that 112 suspects surrendered to the police.
Chinese authorities have long sought to root out those they
term extremists who want to establish an independent state in
Xinjiang called East Turkestan.
Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say
repressive government policies in Xinjiang, including controls
on Islam and on Uighur culture, have provoked unrest, a claim
that Beijing denies.
Hundreds have been killed in the unrest in Xinjiang, the
government has said.
Analysts say most of the economic benefits of developing the
region have gone to the Han Chinese, the country's biggest
ethnic group, stoking resentment among Uighurs.
