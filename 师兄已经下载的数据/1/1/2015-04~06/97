Raging Cop Attacks Black Teens At Pool Party In McKinney, Texas

“Lashauna Burks said her daughter simply wanted to celebrate the end of the school year with her friends on Friday by hosting a party that promised food, fun and music. However, the gathering at the Craig Ranch Community Pool in McKinney, Texas abruptly turned violent when two white women at a nearby pool began making racist comments at the black teen partygoers.
When police officers arrived at the scene, chaos escalated as officers forced teens into handcuffs, with one officer holding a young woman to the ground and pulling a gun on a crowd of black teen partygoers.
Burks, who is black, said she was the sole adult supervisor of her daughter’s event. She left momentarily to grab more materials for the party — and returned to chaos.
“When I left, a 14-year-old girl named Grace had gotten into an argument with two caucasian women,” Burks told HuffPost on Monday.”
