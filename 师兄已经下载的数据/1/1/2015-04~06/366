Silicon Producers Shift to Xinjiang to Become Popular in China - Shanghai Metals Market
SHANGHAI, Apr. 27 (SMM) – More and more silicon producers in China are expected to move to Xinjiang due to low electricity prices, Shanghai Metals Market foresees. 
The power price in Xinjiang will be reduced by 0.093 yuan/kwh on average, the biggest decline across the country, according to its latest round of adjustment in the region.  
By the end of 2014, silicon capacity in Xinjiang reached 650,000 tonnes, 1/4 of China’s total, and the region saw a 50,000-tonne growth in new capacity through the year, 1/3 of China’s total newly-increased capacities, according to data from Silicon Summit on Apr. 23. 
Electricity price constitutes a major part of cost structure in silicon metal production. The power advantage in Xinjiang will continue to attract domestic silicon metal producers to shift to the region.
