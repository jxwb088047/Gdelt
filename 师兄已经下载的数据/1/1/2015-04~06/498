Saudi Arabia, spearheading a coalition of nine Arab states, began carrying out airstrikes in neighbouring Yemen on 25 March 2015, heralding the start of a military intervention codenamed Operation Decisive Storm. The intervention began in response to requests for assistance from the internationally recognized but domestically contested Yemeni government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The request was due to a Houthi offensive aimed at its provisional capital of Aden. President Hadi fled Aden, left the country and went to Saudi Arabia as Saudi Arabia and its allies launched airstrikes in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
Fighter jets from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain are also taking part in the operation. Somalia has made its airspace, territorial waters and military bases available for the coalition to use. The United States has provided intelligence and logistical support, including search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots. It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states. Additionally, Pakistan was called on by Saudi Arabia to join the coalition, but its parliament voted to maintain neutrality. Despite this, Pakistan agreed to provide warships to help the coalition enforce an arms embargo against the Houthis....

The Saudi Arabia-led coalition carrying out attacks against the Houthis in Yemen has failed to investigate its apparently unlawful airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians. The United States is also obligated to investigate attacks in which it played a role that allegedly violated the laws of war.

Human Rights Watch examines in detail 10 apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes that killed at least 309 civilians and wounded more than 414 between April and August 2015. According to the United Nations, most of the 2,600 civilian deaths since the coalition began its military campaign against the Houthis in late March have been from coalition airstrikes. Human Rights Watch is unaware of any investigations by Saudi Arabia, other coalition members, or the US into these or other allegedly unlawful strikes, or of any compensation for victims or their families....

Saudi Arabia launches airstrikes in Yemen against Houthi rebels Saudi Arabia launches airstrikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen

A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has launched air strikes against Shia-led Houthi rebels in Yemen, saying it is \"defending the legitimate government\" of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Saudi jets targeted Houthi positions in the capital Sanaa overnight, along with missile batteries and warplanes. Mr Hadi fled to an undisclosed location after rebel forces neared his refuge in the southern city of Aden on Wednesday.

A Houthi official warned the coalition that it risked provoking a wider war. Shia power Iran, which Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia accuses of backing the rebels, also demanded an immediate halt to the strikes, which it said violated Yemen\'s sovereignty. \"We will make all efforts to control [the] crisis in Yemen,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, according to the Isna news agency. A conflict that pulls in regional powers could disrupt global oil supplies, and the price of Brent crude rose almost 6% after the strikes began....

Zeid bin Ra’ad said the deadly Saudi raids on Yemen show the Kingdom’s repeated failure in preventing such incidents. He said Riyadh is QUOTE- responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together. The attack targeting a busy market was one of the deadliest since Saudi Arabia launched its war on its impoverished neighbor almost a year ago. Saudi warplanes have been pounding Yemeni towns and cities - including residential areas- on almost daily basis. More than 8500 Yemenis, mostly civilians, have been killed so far. Millions more are facing in a dire humanitarian situation. Riyadh has defied calls by international rights bodies to end the aggression.
