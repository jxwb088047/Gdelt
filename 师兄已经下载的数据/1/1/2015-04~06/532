China has banned Ramazan fasting in its Uighur Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang.
Authorities have issued a notice to students, teachers and civil servants in Xinjiang region not to practice fasting during the month of Ramazan.
Restaurants have also received orders to remain open as normal.
“Food service workplaces will operate normal hours during Ramadan,” a notice posted on the website of Food and Drug Administration in Jinghe County stated last week.
Bole County Muslims are told not to engage in fasting during the month of Ramazan.
“During Ramadan do not engage in fasting, vigils or other religious activities,” another post reading on a local government website.
Rights Groups in the region of Uighur criticizing the restrictions say it adds up to the ethnic tension that leave hundreds of people killed every year.
Dilxat Rexit, a spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress says that such will only lead to instability in the region. “Policies that prohibit religious fasting is a provocation and will only lead to instability and conflict,” he said.
China’s restrictions on Muslim religious practices have been widely condemned by Rights Groups.
