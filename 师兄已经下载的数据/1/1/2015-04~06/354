BEIJING, June 28 (Reuters) - A senior ethnic Uighur official
in China's unruly far western region of Xinjiang is being
investigated for suspected serious "discipline violations", the
Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog said on Sunday, using a
euphemism for corruption.
Alimjan Maimaitiming, 55, is secretary general of the
regional government. The Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection gave no other details in its brief statement.
According to his official biography he is from Cherchen,
also known by its Chinese name of Qiemo, in the heavily Uighur
deep south of Xinjiang. He had previously been editor-in-chief
of the official Xinjiang Daily.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the region in the
past few years, most in violence between the Muslim Uighur
people who call Xinjiang home and ethnic majority Han Chinese.
President Xi Jinping has vowed to combat deep-seated
corruption since assuming power in late 2012, although parts of
China with big minority populations like Xinjiang and Tibet have
largely escaped the campaign so far.
The ethnic Uighur mayor of Hotan, also in Xinjiang's deep
south, was put under investigation for graft last year.
The officially atheist Communist Party has striven to
appoint and promote more minority officials but, in Xinjiang
especially, the Han Chinese-dominated party faces deep
suspicion.
Some recent attacks have targeted Uighurs aligned with the
government, including the killing of a state-backed Uighur imam
last July.
