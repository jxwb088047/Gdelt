More HD combat footage from the war in Yemen surfaced.

 It is now more like an Saudi-Yemeni war since the battle was fought on Saudi soil as Houthi rebels attacked Saudi Arabian tanks and border posts with guerrilla warfare tactics using small rebels groups eqipted with small arms, RPGs and ATGM launchers to target Saudi tanks and border posts.

As in the last video a few hours ago the Saudi Army still holds a defensive role without taking offensive action against the rebel attempts to attack Saudi soil.

This footage was filmed like the other one in the Najran Region and shows Houthi fighters battle with Saudi Arabian tanks from large, medium to close distance.

The video features several ineffective but direct RPG hits on Saudi M60 Patton tanks and a ATGM attack in the beginning.

This footage is part of an ongoing documentary of the war in Yemen through raw combat footage.

As the war in Yemen rages on, the Saudi-led coalition suffered their worst loss of the conflict when Houthi missiles struck an army camp. The UAE lost 45 troops – their largest-ever loss of military life. Retaliation was swift and came in the form of more airstrikes.
