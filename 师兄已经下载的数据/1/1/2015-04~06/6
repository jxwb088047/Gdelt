China bans Ramadan fasting in Xinjiang, again
The restaurants have been ordered to stay open while civil servants, students and teachers have been asked to stay away from the practice, Al Jazeera reported.
China has reportedly imposed a ban on fasting in its mainly Muslim Xinjiang region during Ramadan, which began on Thursday in the country.
The restaurants have been ordered to stay open while civil servants, students and teachers have been asked to stay away from the practice, Al Jazeera reported.
Muslims are required to fast from dawn to dusk during the holy month.
"Food service workplaces will operate normal hours during Ramadan," said a notice posted last week on the website of the state Food and Drug Administration in Xinjiang's Jinghe county.
Officials in the region's Bole county were told: "During Ramadan do not engage in fasting, vigils or other religious activities," according to a local government website report of a meeting this week.
Each year, the authorities' attempt to ban fasting among Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang receives widespread criticism from rights groups.
Dilxat Rexit, a spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress told Al Jazeera that the â€œpolicies that prohibit religious fasting is a provocation and will only lead to instability and conflict."
