Government Intervention Is Forcing Muslims in China to Sell Items That Go Against Their Religion
As part of a “Weaken Religion” campaign, authorities in China’s Xinjiang region issued an order to Muslim shop owners to start selling cigarettes and alcohol.
The shop owners, who are part of the Muslim Uighur minority, sold the items in the past, but since 2012 many owners have stopped carrying the items, Party Secretary Adil Sulayman told Radio Free Asia. Many of these products are considered “taboo” for religious reasons.
In addition to directing owners to create “eye-catching displays” to promote the products, the April 29 announcement stated that “anybody who neglects this notice and fails to act will see their shops sealed off, their business suspended, and legal action pursued against them.”
“We have a campaign to weaken religion here and this is part of that campaign.”
The Chinese government claimed the measures are needed to stave off religious separatism and terrorism. The Washington Post reports:
China says Uighur militant groups based abroad are using the Internet to inspire local Muslims to take up violent jihad against the state. Critics say China’s long repression of Uighur rights and nationalist sentiment has pushed people toward Islam as the only permitted assertion of their community’s identity, and pushed a minority toward a violent form of Islam.
In addition to compelling shopkeepers to sell these items, which are considered sinful, the Chinese government has prohibited government employees from observing Ramadan and barred women for wearing veils.
Human Rights Watch states that China “maintains a pervasive system of ethnic discrimination” against the Uighurs.
