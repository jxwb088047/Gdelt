Saudi Arabia has rejected Iran’s call to stop its nearly three-week long military intervention in Yemen. The Saudi foreign minister says Riyadh and its allies have launched airstrikes on Yemen to help what he calls the country’s legitimate authority, a reference to fugitive former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Saudi al-Faisal says the fighting in Yemen has been going on for a year and that he can’t understand how Iran is asking them to stop it. Riyadh has vowed to press ahead with its military aggression against Yemen until Hadi is reinstated. It accuses Iran of interfering in Yemen’s internal affairs. A claim Tehran denies.

Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan said he strongly opposes Pakistan’s possible military intervention in the ongoing conflict in Yemen after Saudi Arabia intervened on Wednesday, when talking to the media after a business forum in Lahore on Friday. 

SOT, Imran Khan, Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (in Urdu): \"Are we entering into another struggle or a war and becoming part of it? I strongly oppose this, I\'m saying this on behalf of the whole of Pakistan. Pakistan is fed up with this and people need peace. If we interfere in this (conflict), at the end the fall out will be in Pakistan. There will be more terrorism and more sectarianism. We strongly oppose this. If Pakistan wants to play a role then we, Saudi Arabia, which is our friend, and Iran which is our neighbour, we should try to help them for a peace agreement.\"
M/S People chanting (Urdu): \"Go Nawaz Go\"

Crowds are due to gather in Sanaa on Friday, April 10, in protest against Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen. Yemen descended into open conflict between several key groups in recent months, pushing the nation to the precipice of full-scale warfare. The Saudi-led intervention, protesters hold, will make Yemen more unstable and could breed a greater conflict.

With Yemen\'s president swept out of power by Shiite rebels, neighboring Saudi Arabia and allies such as Egypt are considering whether and how to intervene to stop a takeover of the country by rebels they believe are backed by Shiite Iran. President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has asked Gulf countries for military intervention and asked the United Nations to set up a no-fly zone to shut down rebel-held airports that he claims are being used to fly in Iranian weapons. The question is how Arab nations might act: Experts say a ground operation would be a likely impossibly daunting task, but that airstrikes are an option.
