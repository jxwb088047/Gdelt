THE Swansea Amnesty International group recently learned that the prisoner of conscience for whom we campaigned was released on May 31.
Ablikim Abdiriyim was imprisoned in the remote Uighur province of north western China since 2007 and his mother's long sentence ended after six years also with Amnesty International's assistance.
They protested against the repression of Uighur music and language especially in schools.
We wish to thank members of the public for their substantial support — 700 cards and scores of letters were sent to Government ministers and regional officials in China to help with Ablikim's unjust sentence, medical neglect and ill treatment in prison.
