Xinjiang Tianshan North Wine Association has signed an agreement with China Agricultural University in an effort to become one of the top wine regions in the world.
The northern region of Tianshan has the same latitude of that of Bordeaux. Winegrowing towns including Manas County, Hutubi County, Fukang, Shihezi, Piqan County, Heshuo County, Yanqi Hui Autonomous County and Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture lie in this region.
The agreement will provide the region with technological support from China Agricultural University and an experiment field for the latter.
