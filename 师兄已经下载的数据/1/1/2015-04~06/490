Radio Islam - China forces Uighurs NOT to Fast, Imams Forced to Dance
This morning, Radio Islam’s Mufti Yusuf Moosagie spoke to Dolkin Issa , Secretary General  of World Uyghur Congress  discussing  reports of China’s barbaric clampdown on Religious Rights .
He discussed the history of the Uighur (Pronounced “Wee Ger” )  struggle:
Occupied in 1949 , 60 years of testing times began for the Uighur.
Official results have us at 10.6 MILLION BUT THE REALITY IS CLOSER TO 20-25 MILLION
He spoke about the lack of identifying with China and their way of life being a catalyst for conflict.
“OUR LANGUAGE IS THE TURKISH LANGUAGE, NO RELIGIOUS OR HISTORIC LINKS WITH CHINA AT ALL”
Whilst Ramadhan has begun amidst excitement across the muslim world, he spoke about the contrasting emotions felt by the Uighur at this time.
“While All the muslim world are happy to begin fasting , unfortunately, uighurs are not.Here, They force people to eat lunch and drink water.
But forcing people NOT to fast is nothing new in terms of recent clampdowns to enforce submission  to the Communist State.
“Last March China, Uighur Imams were forced to Dance, yes, Imams forced to Dance, have you ever seen such a thing anywhere in the world?
Also, the message forced down the Kids is that All the food and drinks are given by the Communist , not By God.” ( NauthooBillah )
He spoke of the heavy handedness of punishments meted out to Muslims in China.
“One Man received 6 years imprisonment for refusing to shave his beard.”
Freedom of Religion is one of the most basic human rights, and the Uighurs are denied any.
“The Uighur situation is going to get worse before it gets better unless something is done. The World must not remain silent”
