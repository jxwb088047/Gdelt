The La Crosse area Amnesty International group is working on gaining freedom for Ilham Tohti of China, who was sentenced to life in prison for "separatism." Amnesty International believes that Tohti is a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for peacefully expressing his beliefs.
Before being sentenced to life in prison on Sept. 23, 2014, Tohti was an economics professor at Minzu University of China in Beijing. He maintains that he is opposed to violence and separatism and that he only raised concerns about social and political issues as a professor. He is the founder of "Uighur Online," a website, and is a widely known critic of China's ethnic and religious policies in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The charge of "separatism" is often used against Uighurs who speak out against human rights violations.
Uighurs are a Turkic ethnic minority who are concentrated primarily in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Most Uighurs are Muslim practitioners. Since the 1980s, the Uighurs have been the target of systematic and extensive human rights violations including arbitrary detention and imprisonment, incommunicado detentions, and serious restrictions on religious practice.
Please join our local Amnesty International group to help free Tohti. Our next meeting is at 7 p.m. Wednesday in Room 104 of Viterbo University's School of Nursing building.
