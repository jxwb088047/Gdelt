EGYPT â CHINA Al-Azhar calls on Beijing to lift restrictions on Muslims during Ramadan
Cairo (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Al-Azhar, the leading Muslim seat of learning, condemned China for imposing restrictions on fasting in Xinjiang during the holy month of Ramadan.
Based in Egypt, the Sunni institution has called on Beijing to allow the Muslim community in the province to observe the fast and participate in religious activities during the holy month.
Out of Xinjiang’s 22 million people, almost nine million are indigenous Muslim Uighurs. Deemed a hotbed of terrorism, the region has seen rising tensions due to Beijing’s restrictive ethnic and religious policies.
Over the years, clashes and violent incidents have broken out between native Uighurs and ethnic Han Chinese settlers brought in by the Chinese government to swamp the indigenous population.
“Al-Azhar and its grand imam, Ahmed Al-Tayeb (pictured), condemn the Chinese authorities’ ban on Muslims from fasting and practicing their religious rituals during Ramadan in some parts of the western Xinjiang region,” said a statement from the Cairo-based Al-Azhar.
“Al-Azhar rejects all forms of oppression practiced against Uighur Muslims in China that affect their religious rights and personal freedoms,” said the prestigious institution, which called on the international community, the United Nations and human rights groups to end these violations.
AsiaNews spoke to Josephine, one of hundreds of Christians from Al-Hasakah, who spent a year in the hands of the Islamic State group. She talked about psychological suffering, conversion attempts, and separation from her male relatives. She survived thanks to her faith. Her mother Caroline, a Caritas official, is the only one in her family to have been spared the ordeal. She also negotiated their release with IS, and gave a Jihadi copies of the Bible. Now she hopes “to meet the pope” with her entire family.
Sister Rani Maria was killed in 1995, stabbed 54 times. The murderer was a radical Hindu, incited by village leaders, who wanted to stop the nun's activities in favor of tribal poor. The path "that led me to forgive Samunder Singh has not been easy, but now he's my brother." Instead, "my mother said once: 'I would kiss his hands, because on them there is the blood of my daughter'." The exchange of the Indian bracelet that celebrates love between siblings; the moment of encounter with the victim's mother.
