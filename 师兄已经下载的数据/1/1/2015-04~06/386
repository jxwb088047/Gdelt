Critics Attack Seymour Hersh After Bin Laden Raid Story Goes Public
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiMay 13, 2015Leave a Comment
Seymour Hersh published a HUGE article on what actually happened during the Osama bin Laden raid in Pakistan. There’s a lot of dispute about this article, and Cenk comes out somewhere in the middle. The critics are saying that the reporting is thinly sourced. Cenk Uygur (host of The Young Turks) goes over the disputed details, and goes on to show and discusses the attempts to smear Hersh’s “The Killing of Osama bin Laden”. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Legendary reporter Seymour Hersh published a major and long-awaited revision of the account of the killing of Osama bin Laden in the London Review of Books Sunday, one which former acting director of the CIA Mike Morell called “all wrong” on CBS This Morning.
In the article Hersh alleges that the Obama administration’s version of events is so fictional as to constitute a Lewis Carroll story — his allusion — and that much of what the public thinks of as a daring, all-American raid was actually performed in conjunction with Pakistani officials who knew full well where bin Laden was. According to Hersh the U.S. actually learned of bin Laden’s whereabouts not through tradecraft but by paying a Pakistani source close to $25 million.
Not so, sayeth Morell, who stopped reading in disgust. “Every sentence I was reading was wrong,” Morrell said Monday morning. “The source that Hersh talked to has no idea what he’s talking about. The person obviously was not close to what happened. The Pakistanis did not know….The president made a decision not to tell the Pakistanis. The Pakistanis were furious with us. The president sent me to Pakistan after the raids to start smoothing things over.”*
