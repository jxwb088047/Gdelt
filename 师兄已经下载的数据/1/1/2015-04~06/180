Law or no law, Canadians better not criticise Israel - Worldnews.com

Is Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper inching towards criminalising criticism of Israel?
Since first elected in 2006, his Conservative government has been pointing in that direction. Tiny gestures to be sure. But, taken together,

\"Hi, my name is Hala. The Canadian parliament recently passed a motion to formally condemn the BDS movement - the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. The problem is that it is our freedom of speech and our freedom of choice that we are touching.
Countries that do not respect human rights and international law need to be condemned, not the BDS movement. Countries like Saudi Arabia that do not respect women\'s liberty. Where Raif Badawi is condemned to a thousand lashes for criticizing radical Islam. Countries like Israel, that still in 2016 colonize, bomb and treat Palestinians like third class citizens.\"

“If I win, I will proudly wear my crown on a boat to Gaza, in protests for social justice and against austerity,” says Hala, Miss Canada finalist, a civil engineer and board member of PAJU (Palestinian & Jewish Unity).

When assessing her chances of winning on March 5, she asks:
“Does Miss Canada want that kind of publicity? Miss Canada calling for a boycott of Israel? I don’t think so.”

Whether they want this kind of publicity or not, they probably will get some of it since the Canadian Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of a motion condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) last week. Apart from her desire to promote the rights of indigenous people from Turtle Island, as they used to call Canada, defending the rights of the Palestinians and calling for the boycott of Israel happen to be the main reasons why Hala is part of the Miss Canada contest. “I’m using the platform to spre...

A Canadian organization is defying the government’s warning not to encourage boycotts against Israel.

The Canadian Friends Service Committee says it will support the \'Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\' campaign against Tel Aviv over its aggressive policies. The religious organization says it will ignore the government’s threat to use hate crime laws against any group which calls for the boycott of Israel. Back in January, Ottawa signed a memorandum with Tel Aviv to fight the campaign which is gaining momentum worldwide. The movement calls for the boycott of Israel on economic, cultural and intellectual levels over its occupation of Palestinian land and aggressive policies against Palestinians.

\"Has a #JeSuisBDS hashtag started trending yet on Twitter? Under the new Charlie Hebdo standard — it’s not enough to defend free speech; one must praise and even express the speech targeted with suppression — have all of the newfound free speech crusaders begun organizing pro-Israel-boycott rallies in order to defy these suppression efforts? In a zillion years, could anyone imagine the popularity-craving officials who run PEN America bestowing one of their glamorous awards on advocates of the Israel-targeted Boycott/Divestment/Sanctions movement? The answer to all of those questions is and will remain “no,” because (as I discussed last week here with Bob Wright) the Charlie Hebdo ritual (for most, not all) was about many agendas having nothing to do with the free expression banner under which it paraded.

In that regard, Stephen Harper is the perfect Poster Boy for how free expression is tribalistically manipulated and exploited in the West. When the views being suppressed are ones amenable to those in power (e.g., cartoons mocking Islam), free speech is venerated; attempts to suppress those kinds of ideas show that “they have declared war on any country, like ourselves, that values freedom, openness and tolerance.” We get to celebrate ourselves as superior and progressive and victimized, and how good that feels. But when ideas are advocated that upset those in power (e.g. speech by Muslims critical of Western nations and their allies), the very same people acquiesce to, or expressly endorse, full-scale suppression. Thus can the Canadian Prime Minister pompously parade arou...

The United Church of Canada has defended its decision to promote a boycott of Israeli products produced in illegal settlements. The church has found itself being criticized by pro-Israel media pundits in Canada who denounced the Church\'s decision as one-sided. Church leaders say their decision to pass motions which endorse a boycott aligns them with the international legal consensus on the settlements.

McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario is the latest to support the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Students at the university\'s annual general assembly voted in favor of the campaign. A similar vote in March of last year didn\'t receive enough quorum for passage. Toronto\'s York University, Windsor University in Ontario and University of Ottawa have already approved the boycott in protest at what they call Israeli apartheid. The student campaign is gaining momentum despite the Canadian government\'s staunch support for Israel. Universities across Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have also joined the campaign.

The United Church of Canada is well known for siding with the underdog and now they\'ve taken a stand with the Palestinian victims of Israeli occupation. 

Canada\'s largest protestant denomination voted to promote an economic boycott of products produced in illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories at a national assembly this week. 

Perhaps predictably, supporters of Israel\'s violations of international law in Canada\'s influential Zionist community have insinuated that the United Church is exhibiting \"anti-Semitism\". 

The United Church however maintains that its decision to promote a boycott of certain Israeli products is guided by international legal opinion and the church\'s staunch anti-racist belief in the equality of human beings. 

The Canadian government has voiced opposition to proposed boycotts of Israel but pro-Palestinian activists in the United Church argue that the injustice against Palestinians, some of whom are Christian, is so egregious that strong economic action against Israel is needed. 

Activists say that the Canadian government should take a more balanced approach towards the Israel/Palestine conflict and should not be seen to be affording impunity to Israel when it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity. 

While Israel\'s numerous supporters in the Canadian mainstream media have attempted to make the United Church\'s endorsement of international law appear radical, United Church members draw attention to the increased international consensus on the illegality of the settlements. 

Members of the church suggest that peace will o...

Activists are increasingly advising consumers in Vancouver, British Columbia and Alberta NOT to buy products made by the Israelis. A Montreal-based group known as Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East is distributing stickers to be affixed on Israeli products. The B-D-S is a global movement aimed at banning Israeli entities that are involved in the violation of Palestinian rights. Members of the movement boycott Israeli products and companies as well as cultural and academic institutions. Meanwhile, a far-right Jewish group in Canada has written to the federal minister of public safety urging him to stop the anti-Israel movement.

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the early 20th century. The conflict is wide-ranging, and the term is also used in reference to the earlier phases of the same conflict, between the Zionist yishuv and the Arab population living in Palestine under Ottoman and then British rule. It forms part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. The remaining key issues are: mutual recognition, borders, security, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements,Palestinian freedom of movement and legalities concerning refugees. The violence resulting from the conflict has prompted international actions, as well as other security and human rights concerns, both within and between both sides, and internationally. In addition, the violence has curbed expansion of tourism in the region, which is full of historic and religious sites that are of interest to many people around the world.
Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside an independent Jewish state or next to the State of Israel (after Israel's establishment in 1948). As recently as 2007, a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, prefer the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict. Moreover, a considerable majority of the Jewish public sees the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state. A majority of Palestinians and Israelis view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an acceptable location of the hypothetical Palestinian state in a two-state solution. However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments.
