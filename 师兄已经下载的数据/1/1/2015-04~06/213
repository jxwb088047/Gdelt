China netted over 180 groups in anti-terrorism drive - Asia - Around the globe - World - Dalje.com
An anti-terrorism sweep in north-western China broke up 181 groups last year, Chinese state media reported Monday.
The police operation, which lasted three and a half weeks from April 30, was launched as a series of deadly attacks blamed on ethnic Uighurs hit the restive region of Xinjiang.
Tensions have been rife for years between the Uighurs, a primarily Muslim Turkic ethnic minority, and the majority Han Chinese.
About 96 per cent of the groups were in "preparatory stages" and "planning to do [something]," according to the People's Daily mouthpiece, without providing details.

Some 112 people had also turned themselves in, the report said.

Dozens of people accused of involvement in past attacks have been jailed and some executed because of unrest in Xinjiang.
