Ethnic Uighur man shot by police - Evening Express
Chinese police have shot an ethnic Uighur man dead after he tried to attack travellers at a train station with a cement block.
Officials in the northern city of Xi’an said a police officer repeatedly warned the man before shooting him as he attacked travellers buying tickets at the city’s main station.
A message on the force’s microblog said the man died in hospital from his injuries and that normal order has been restored.
Ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur minority and China’s Han majority have periodically erupted into violence in recent years, leaving hundreds dead.
Last year, a group of Uighurs armed with knives killed 31 people at a train station in the south-western city of Kunming.
