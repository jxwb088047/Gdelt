China's One Belt, One Road Initiative isn't just about infrastructure connectivity, it's also about people, and connecting them with other communities and opportunities. For years, a leading medical expert and professor in Xinjiang has been devoted to encouraging medical and educational exchange between the region and the rest of the world. Wu Guoxiu talked to him and brings us his story, in Episode 4 of our Silk Road series.
Professor Halmurat Upur is multi-lingual. It comes in handy when treating foreign patients, some he says who were important politicians and celebrities. This lady is from Kazakhstan.
"She was awarded the Mother Heroine title by the Soviet Union during the Second World War for giving birth to 12 children. Her son received Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments here, so she came here too," Professor Halmurat said.
Patients come from far and wide to this Xinjiang hospital to receive its traditional treatments and herbs.
Twenty percent of patients in this hospital are from central Asian countries and Russia....Uygur medicine.
Professor Halmurat says this "Uygur Medicine" is based on its own system of knowledge, developed through centuries of exchanges on the Silk Road.And he's dedicated decades of his own life to ensuring it continues to grow.
"The theories of Uygur Medicine can be traced to ancient Greco-Arabic Medicine. Many foreign experts who've come here have found that Uygur Medicine can be understood in Central Asia,Western Asia and even Europe. I think it can easily be accepted by China's neighboring countries," Professor Halmurat said.
Last year, world medical experts gathered in Urumqi for the third conference on Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Western and Uygur Medicine. Delegates from 24 countries there agreed to found a Silk Road International Medical Academy.  Professor Halmurat was one of the leaders.
"First we'll build a special medical center in Xinjiang, bringing in the world's top experts and techniques. We are also setting up a joint medical research center, to educate more talents for Silk Road countries, who understands the three types of medicine," Professor Halmurat said.  International students here from Central Asia are interested in learning everything China has to offer.
"I major in clinical medicine. I want to get a master's degree and work here first. I will also learn acupuncture for a year, that's a must-learn for me in China," Student from Tajikistan Bakhtiyor said.
"I majored in both Chinese and Western medicine. I want to go back after graduation. In my country, Chinese doctors learn much more. People like Traditional Chinese Medicine," Student from Kazakhstan Aigerim said.
To further promote these educational exchanges, China will provide 10,000 government scholarships to countries along the Belt and Road every year. It will continue the long tradition of sharing goods and knowledge along the Silk Road.
