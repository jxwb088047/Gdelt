After 42 hours overtime, the Iran nuclear negotiations with the United States, Russia, China, France, Great Britain and Germany reached a framework deal in Lausanne, Switzerland. In return for lifting the sanctions, which means more than $110 billion a year relief for Tehran and a return to the global economic market, Iran will be significantly constrained in its nuclear programme. This is the framework agreement, meaning the formal deal will be signed before July 1st. Over the next three months, the technical details will have to be worked out, but what does the Iranian nuclear deal really mean?

Republicans in the House have rejected President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, at least symbolically. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Wes Clark Jr., hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"The House on Friday rejected a resolution to approve the Iran nuclear deal, with the vote underscoring how controversial the accord has been with President Obama’s own party.

While most Democrats voted to approve the nuclear bargain, 25 voted against it, creating a wedge that Republicans hope to use to their advantage in the 2016 elections.

Every Republican voted against the resolution, with the exception of libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who voted \"present.\" The tally was 162-269.”*
