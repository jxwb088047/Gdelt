http://democracynow.org - Four years after U.S. forces assassinated Osama bin Laden, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh has published an explosive piece claiming much of what the Obama administration said about the attack was wrong. Hersh claims at the time of the U.S. raid, bin Laden had been held as a prisoner by Pakistani intelligence since 2006. Top Pakistani military leaders knew about the operation and provided key assistance. Contrary to U.S. claims that it located bin Laden by tracking his courier, a former Pakistani intelligence officer identified bin Laden’s whereabouts in return for the bulk of a $25 million U.S. bounty. Questions are also raised about whether bin Laden was actually buried at sea, as the U.S. claimed. Hersh says instead the Navy SEALs threw parts of bin Laden’s body into the Hindu Kush mountains from their helicopter. The White House claims the piece is \"riddled with inaccuracies.\" Hersh joins us to lay out his findings and respond to criticism from government officials and media colleagues.

Seymour M. Hersh published a giant story about how the Osama bin Laden raid actually went down in Pakistan. The United States government is super angry about this report and have begun fighting back full with force in the media. Cenk Uygur (Host of The Young Turks) breaks down Hersh\'s report on the bin Laden raid, and goes on to discuss the issues with the reporting, and the reaction by the establishment. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

Read \"The Killing of Osama bin Laden\" by Seymour M. Hersh here: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden

\"It’s been four years since a group of US Navy Seals assassinated Osama bin Laden in a night raid on a high-walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The killing was the high point of Obama’s first term, and a major factor in his re-election. The White House still maintains that the mission was an all-American affair, and that the senior generals of Pakistan’s army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) were not told of the raid in advance. This is false, as are many other elements of the Obama administration’s account. The White House’s story might have been written by Lewis Carroll: would bin Laden, target of a massive international manhunt, really decide that a resort town forty miles from Islamabad would be the safest place to live and command al-Qaida’s operations? He was hiding in the open. So America said.\"*

\"Legendary reporter Seymour Hersh published a major and long-awaited revision of the account of the killing of Osama bin Laden in the London Review of Books Sunday, one which former acting director of the CIA Mike Morell called “all wrong” on CBS This Morning.

According to Hersh the U.S. actually learned of bin Laden’s whereabouts not through tradecraft but by paying a Pakistani source close to $25 million.

Famed investigative journalist Seymour Hersch discusses his piece claiming President Obama lied about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden....
Cenk Uygur host of The Young Turks discuss the treasure trove of letters from Bin Laden\'s compound released to dispute Seymour Hersh\'s recent article.

Wednesday morning, the US government released a huge tranche of documents found in Osama bin Laden\'s compound in Abbottabad after the raid that killed him in 2011. These documents tell us a lot about bin Laden, from his family down to his taste in think tank reports. And they also show one way in which his strategic vision for al-Qaeda led to a bad misreading of the opportunities created by the Arab Spring — a strategic mistake, in fact, that helped fuel the rise of ISIS as a major global jihadist group.

There\'s one undated letter in particular that makes this point clear. It\'s addressed to Atiyah abd al-Rahman, a now-deceased al-Qaeda figure who served as a conduit between bin Laden and the rest of the top al-Qaeda leadership. In the letter, bin Laden explicitly warns against creating an \"Islamic State\" — that is, to do exactly what ISIS has done in the past year.

Bin Laden warns that the United States was still strong enough to bust up any government jihadis founded in the Middle East, so the establishment of an Islamic State needed to wait until the United States had been defeated and forced out of the Middle East.

Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has published a 10,000-word story on the 2011 killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that differs starkly with the official version of events.

Among the main assertions in the report from Seymour Hersh is that the U.S. learned of Bin Laden\'s whereabouts from a walk-in to the CIA station at the U.S. embassy in Islamabad.

Hersh states that in August of 2010, a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer offered the information in exchange for the $25 million dollar reward the U.S. posted in 2001.

U.S. and Pakistan intelligence officials originally agreed to concoct a story that Osama bin Laden had been killed in a drone strike on the Afghanistan side of the border. The plan was to announce the killing one week after the raid and report that DNA gathered from the drone strike confirmed the killing.

CNN\'s Anderson Cooper spoke with veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who says that the White House account of the Osama bin Laden raid is a lie....
Osama bin Laden, the former head of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda known for the September 11 attacks, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1 am local time by Navy SEALs of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a Central Intelligence Agency-led operation. Participating units included the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six), the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), and CIA operatives. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death.
Al-Qaeda confirmed the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, also vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. Bin Laden's killing was generally favorably received by U.S. public opinion; was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and a large number of governments; but was condemned by some, including Fidel Castro of Cuba and Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas administration of the Gaza Strip. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision to not release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.
