BEIJING - "Shaheen (Eagle)-4," a joint drill between the air forces of China and Pakistan, began on Sunday in China, a military spokesperson announced.
The Chinese contingent includes fighter jets, fighter bombers and early warning planes while its Pakistani counterpart dispatched fighter jets and early warning planes, according to Air Force spokesperson Shen Jinke.
Shen, however, did not say how long the drill would last.
The joint exercise is part of a series of military exchange programs between the two air forces, Shen said, adding that China's Air Force was willing to expand the scope of cooperation with various countries.
