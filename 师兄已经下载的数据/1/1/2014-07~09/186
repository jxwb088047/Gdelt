Two suspects have been killed and another one in custody after a standoff with police after the murder of a Chinese religious leader in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
Police stated the suspects Turghun Tursun, Memetjan Remutillan and Nurmemet Abidilimit, tried to resist arrest, brandishing knives and axes. Officers responded with lethal action, shooting them down. The three suspects were wanted in connection to the murder of Jume Tahir, imam of China’s largest mosque, the Id Kah Mosque which is located in the city of Kashgar.
The 74-year-old imam enjoyed a high reputation among Muslims nationwide. He was killed on Wednesday after he finished leading morning prayers. According to police, the three suspects were influenced by religious extremism, and wanted to do something big like kill Tahir. The death of Tahir has stirred widespread anger among Muslims in Xinjiang, with people from all walks of life condemning the murder.
