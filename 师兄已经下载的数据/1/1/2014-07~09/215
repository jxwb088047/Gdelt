Chinese militants from the western region of Xinjiang have fled from the country to get "terrorist training" from ISIS fighters for attacks at home, state media reported Monday.The report was the first time state-run media had linked militants from Xinjiang, home to ethnic minority Uighur Muslims, to militants of the Al-Qaeda breakaway group that has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq.China's government has blamed a surge of violence over the past year on Islamist militants from Xinjiang who China says are fighting for an independent state called East Turkestan."Terrorists, separatists and extremists" from Xinjiang have often slipped abroad through mountainous provinces in southern China with porous border areas, because border control in Xinjiang was strict, the newspaper said.
