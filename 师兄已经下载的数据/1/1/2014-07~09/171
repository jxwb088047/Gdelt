China opposes EU interference in judicial independence - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn|china|news|chinanews|ecns|cns
The Chinese Mission to the European Union (EU) on Wednesday expressed "strong dissatisfaction" after the bloc criticized the life sentence given to a Uygur teacher for separatism.
China is "strongly dissatisfied" with the EU's statement on that case and "resolutely opposed any interference in China's judicial sovereignty and independence," the mission's spokesperson said in a statement.
When commenting on the EU labeling Ilham Tohti, a former teacher with Beijing-based Minzu University of China, as a "respected academic" person, the statement said the so-called "respected academic" is a convicted criminal who has openly championed violence, instigated ethnic hatred and stirred up ethnic confrontations in China.
The statement also stressed such an act is considered as violation of law likewise in Europe and the case has been tried fairly and publicly. Lawful rights and interests of the defendant have been duly protected, it added.
"Our resolve and efforts to govern the country under the rule of law will never bend to those irresponsible remarks," said the spokesperson.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the European External Action Service condemned the life sentence for separatism handed out to Ilham Tohti and called for his immediate and unconditional release.
Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life imprisonment for separatism in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Tuesday.
According to the ruling, he spread lessons containing separatist thoughts via a website, coerced students to work for the website, and built a criminal syndicate.
