Abu Qatada al-Filistini (Arabic: أبو قتادة الفلسطيني‎, ’Abū Qatāda al-Filisṭīnī; born 1959/60), is the conventional name of Omar Mahmoud Othman (Arabic: عمر بن محمود بن عثمان‎ ‘Umar ibn Maḥmūd ibn ‘Uṯmān), a Palestinian Muslim of Jordanian citizenship. He is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations Security Council Committee 1267 for his alleged affiliation with al-Qaeda. Repeatedly imprisoned in Britain since he was first detained under anti-terrorism laws in 2002, he has not been prosecuted there for any criminal or conspiracy offences. The Algerian government has described Abu Qatada as being involved with Islamists in London and possibly elsewhere. After initially barring the United Kingdom from deporting Qatada to Jordan, in May 2012 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that he could be deported on the basis of assurances from Jordan that he will not be tortured.
Abu Qatada has Jordanian nationality because he was born in Bethlehem in the West Bank in 1960, which at that time was occupied by Jordan. In 1989 he went to Peshawar, where the BBC has written that "some say he met Osama Bin Laden." Abu Qatada has always distanced himself from links to Al Qaeda and insisted he has never met with Osama Bin Laden.Jason Burke has written that, "Qutada [sic] has impeccable traditional and modern Salafist credentials and had acted as the in-house alim to radical groups, particularly in Algeria, from his base in northwest London since 1994". In 2001, after bin Laden was criticised by a Salafist faction for issuing fatwas, he turned to Abu Qatada for support, and the support was forthcoming. In 1991, after the Gulf War, Abu Qatada was expelled from Kuwait along with many other Palestinians. He returned to Jordan, but in September 1993 he fled with his wife and five children to the UK, using a forged UAE passport. He requested asylum on grounds of religious persecution and this was granted in June 1994.
