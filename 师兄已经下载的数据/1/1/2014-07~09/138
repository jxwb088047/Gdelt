Karzai takes one last swipe at US






Kabul, September 23



 Outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai used his farewell speech today to take one last swipe at the United States, capping a long-testy relationship with the accusation that America hasn't wanted peace in Afghanistan.
The only president Afghanistan has known since the 2001 US-led invasion said the United States wanted war in Afghanistan "because of its own interests."
Karzai's relationship with the US has grown increasingly fragile in recent years, but the US-Afghan relationship may get a reset yesterday, when President-elect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai will be sworn in.

Israel kills 2 Palestinians wanted for murdering three Jewish teens



Jerusalem, September 23

 Ending more than three months of manhunt, Israeli security forces today shot dead two Palestinians blamed for the June kidnapping and killings of three Israeli teenagers that spiralled into a 50-day conflict with Hamas, killing more than 2,100 people.

Israel Defence Forces (IDF) stormed into a West Bank hideout early today and killed the two Palestinian suspects in an exchange of fire, the army said. "Both the suspects were killed in an Israeli operation," IDF spokesman Peter Lerner said. It was later confirmed by Hamas, which had initially denied responsibility for the abduction and murder of the Israeli teenagers, though later accepted its role in funding and executing the killings.
Israel's internal security agency, Shin Bet, said the two suspects, Marwan Qawasmeh (29) and Amer Abu Aysha (32), were hiding in a house in Hebron area in West Bank.
The house was surrounded by the Israeli forces before dawn, security sources said, adding the suspects had automatic weapons and were killed "in an exchange of fire".
Three additional people suspected of involvement in the kidnapping, all from the Qawasmeh family, were arrested during the operation. Lerner told reporters that there was a breakthrough in the search a week ago that led security forces to the hideout.
The three Israeli teenagers, Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Sha'ar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, 16 (also a US citizen), were abducted while they were hitchhiking at night near Gush Etzion in the West Bank.
Israeli forces launched a massive search operation in Gaza strip, rounding up hundreds of suspected Hamas affiliates in the door-to-door search operations that significantly escalated tensions between the two. The bodies of the three teenagers were later found on July 1.
The killings sparked a chain of violent events, including the suspected revenge killing of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem and helped trigger the seven-week long conflict between Israel and Hamas controlled Gaza strip that killed more than 2,100 people, mostly Palestinians, and displaced thousands more.혰 PTI
Egypt-mediated Gaza ceasefire talks resume


Egypt-mediated talks between Israel and the Palestinians on cementing a ceasefire in Gaza resumed on a sour note on Tuesday after Israel's killing of
 two Hamas militants in the occupied West Bank.
The first meeting began in Cairo around noon under the leadership of Egyptian intelligence, having been delayed for almost two hours while Palestinian factions discussed whether to suspend the negotiations.
Israel launched the offensive on July 8 with the declared aim of halting cross-border rocket salvoes by Hamas and other militant groups.
Egypt-mediated talks in July and August succeeded in securing a series of ceasefires aimed at laying the groundwork for talks on a broader deal.





IS releases 2nd video of British hostage




London, September 23

 The Islamic State militants have released a second video of British journalist John Cantlie in less than a week which shows him warning US-led coalition against carrying out military operations against his captors.
In the latest five-minute video, Cantlie warns that the United States and its allies are embarking on "Gulf War III", adding "Not since Vietnam have we witnessed such a potential mess in the making"."Current estimates of 15,000 troops needed to fight the Islamic State are laughably low. The State has more mujahideen than this. And this is not some undisciplined outfit with a few Kalashnikovs," Cantlie said in the video.Dressed in orange against a backdrop showing cuttings from the 'New York Times', the 43-year-old freelance photojournalist introduces himself as "the British citizen abandoned by my government and long-term prisoner of the Islamic State".The video follows the similar pattern to the first video featuring the journalist and is introduced with the title "Lend Me Your Ears" and "Messages From The British Detainee John Cantlie". He describes the IS as the "most powerful jihadist movement seen in recent history" and that the US led group could not harm it. 혰 PTI

Kabul, September 23

 Outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai used his farewell speech today to take one last swipe at the United States, capping a long-testy relationship with the accusation that America hasn't wanted peace in Afghanistan.

The only president Afghanistan has known since the 2001 US-led invasion said the United States wanted war in Afghanistan "because of its own interests."
Karzai's relationship with the US has grown increasingly fragile in recent years, but the US-Afghan relationship may get a reset yesterday, when President-elect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai will be sworn in.
The US has spent more than $100 billion on aid in Afghanistan since 2001 to train and equip the country's security forces, to pave crumbling dirt roads, to upgrade hospitals and to build schools.
But Karzai in his speech thanked a slew of countries for their help India, Japan, China, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Germany without mentioning the US.
The speech fingered the US and the military leaders of neighbouring Pakistan as the powers backing perpetual war.
"If America and Pakistan really want it, peace will come to Afghanistan," Karzai said. "War in Afghanistan is based on the aims of foreigners. The war in Afghanistan is to the benefit of foreigners. But Afghans on both sides are the sacrificial lambs and victims of this war."
More than 2,200 US forces have died in Afghanistan operations since 2001. Nearly 20,000 have been wounded.
The United Nations says that some 8,000 Afghan civilians have been killed in the conflict over the last five years alone.
In his final year in office Karzai refused to sign a security agreement with the US that would set the legal framework to allow about 10,000 American military advisers and trainers to stay in the country next year. Ghani Ahmadzai has said he will sign it. 혰 AP


5 killed in Peshawar suicide attack




 Afzal Khan in Islamabad
 


At least five persons were killed and 18 others sustained injuries in a bomb attack on Frontier Corps (FC) convoy near the Peshawar Press Club on Tuesday.

The blast, believed to be a suicide attack, reportedly targeted the car of a senior army officer, Brigadier Khalid Javed while he was on his way to the office. Brigadier Khalid, Director General of Frontier Corps, escaped with minor injuries. This was one of the major, though, relatively scarce attacks, by terrorists in Peshawar since the military launched operation against Taliban in North Waziristan.
An ISPR official confirmed the death toll and said the injured were shifted to the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) and Combined Military Hospital (CMH), two of whom are reportedly in critical condition.
Security forces cordoned off the entire area soon after the attack and barred people from entering the police lines. The ISPR said initial investigation into the attack suggest that it was a suicide blast targeting the convoy of DIG FC Brigadier Khalid Javed, the second-most senior officer in the FC force.

Turkey혪s alleged deal to liberate its nationals held in Iraq is the latest twist in the Islamic State (IS) hostage crisis.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pointedly refused to deny reports by his country혪s media commentators that as part of a reciprocal deal Ankara used its influence to free Islamic militants from Syrian prisons. At stake were the lives of some 49 Turkish hostages, including diplomatic, held hostage by IS for more than four months.
혫Even if this swap took place, as the President, I always look after my 49 citizens혬, Erdogan said in New York on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly summit. 혫Nothing can be of more value than my citizens.혬
A pro-government Turkish newspaper columnist commented over the week end, 혫A few names who are of great significance (to IS) have been used in the swap.혬
The Turks were among scores of foreigners, including 39 Indians, captured in the Iraq-Syria border area and facing an uncertain future. US journalist James Foley was the first of the high profile Western hostages who was murdered by beheading last August.
His murder preceded the killing of a second US journalist Steven Sotloff, followed by the murder earlier this month of British aid worker David Haines. The IS has also threatened another British national, Alan Henning, who was working with an Islamic charity taking aid to refugees. The number of hostages in IS hands is unclear because their families, governments and employers prefer to stay silent out of concern that the victims혪 lives would be put in danger.
But in the last few weeks at least two more Americans, a Dane, a Japanese and two Italians are also believed to have been kidnapped. Their capture is part of a process that started in 2012 and has generated funds for the IS terrorists.
The US and Britain have so far refused to pay ransom or negotiate with the IS, but a number of European governments have reportedly handed over cash in exchange for the release of their citizens.
Meanwhile, as Western governments refine strategies to tackle IS, the militants have also raised the stakes by calling for all-out war against countries that 혫entered into a coalition against the IS.혬
