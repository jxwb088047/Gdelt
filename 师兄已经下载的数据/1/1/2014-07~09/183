Xinjiang frontier soldier marries sweetheart through satellite broadcast, melts hearts: Shanghaiist
After a mission prevented Xinjiang Frontier Army leader Liang Tao from marrying his girlfriend in person, his platoon melted everyone's hearts by throwing them a "video wedding."
Liang and his sweetheart, surnamed Yang, had reportedly planned the wedding for July 26, but it was called off when Liang was assigned to a military mission.
Though Liang was on leave, he was forced to stay in Xinjiang as he was the only leader available.
Xinjiang Army Commissioner Zhang Jianguo acknowledged this and promised that they could keep the wedding date and enjoy an extraordinary wedding. After some preliminary meetings, the army eventually decided to throw them a video wedding.
Liang's unit company throws them a surprise wedding. Frontier residents also give their blessings.
Yang burst into tears when she saw her husband on the monitor.
"Thank you for everything you prepared for me. Although my husband is not with me here right now, this is a more meaningful and unforgettable wedding than others, "said Yang.
