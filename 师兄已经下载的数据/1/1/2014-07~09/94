 Indonesian police say four suspected Islamic militants arrested over the weekend are members of China's ethnic Uighur minority community. Authorities initially said the four were Turkish, which has linguistic and ethnic ties with the Uighur homeland of Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China. The men were arrested Saturday while travelling in a car in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province, which is home to a network of Indonesian extremists. National Police spokesman Col. Agus Rianto said Monday that police were investigating them on suspicion of seeking contact with a wanted militant and having possible links to the Islamic State group in Syria. Xinjiang is home to a separatist insurgency that is infused with Islamist militancy, and Uighurs are known to have travelled to global jihadi hot spots, including the Pakistani border.
