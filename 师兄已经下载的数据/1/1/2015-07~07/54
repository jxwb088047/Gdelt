Largest ocean likely under Tarim basin in Xinjiang: Chinese scientists | Tehelka - Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts
Chinese scientists said that there could an ‘ocean’ hidden beneath Tarim basin in northwestern Xinjiang province, which could be equivalent to 10 times the water in all five Great Lakes of North America.
Tarim is home to Taklimakan, the biggest desert in China.âNever before could people imagine so much water under the sand. Our definition of desert may have to change,â said professor Li Yan.
Professor Li Yan, who led the study at Chinese Academy of Sciencesâ Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography in Urumqi said, âExact estimates are difficult because surface water in the region, such as rivers and lakes appear at random in various locations, making measurement impossible. Liâs team stumbled on the discovery by sheer accident. âWe were after carbon, but we stumbled across water,â he said.
Greenhouse gas can be absorbed in certain regionsâsuch as forests and oceans known as carbon sinks. Locating them may help scientists better understand climate change.
Around 10 years ago, Liâs team discovered large amounts of carbon dioxide disappear in Tarim without explanation. In a paper in Geophysical Research Letters, Liâs team stated there could be a large amountÂ of water under earth’s largest deserts which serve as carbon sinks.Â 
The team took samples of the underground water samples from nearly 200 locations across the desert. By measuring the amount of carbon dioxide in these samples, the scientists were able to calculate how much water had flown into the basin.
The soil of farmland in the region is alkaline, helping the carbon dioxide to dissolve into the water. Li said the ocean under Tarim would cannot be put into immediate use for Xinjiang’s economic development.
The water is not just salty, but contains a large amount of carbon dioxide. âItâs like a can of coke. If it is opened, all the greenhouse gas will escape into the atmosphere,â he said.
The biggest question now is whether similar âoceansâ can be also be found under other large deserts, such as Sahara. The chance of water under these deserts is high because the amount of carbon in these âoceans could reach a trillion tonne.
