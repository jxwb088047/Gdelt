Hundreds march in Istanbul in support of Uighurs - San Jose Mercury News
ISTANBUL (AP) â€” Hundreds of people have marched in Istanbul to protest against China's treatment of its minority Muslim Uighur community.
The group, which has cultural ties to Turkey, has complained of cultural and religious suppression under Chinese rule.
The protesters on Saturday carried flags representing the Uighurs' homeland and called for a boycott of Chinese goods. The demonstration was peaceful but the Dogan news agency said a group of nationalists tried to attack a group of Korean tourists which they mistook for Chinese nationals. Police rescued the tourists.
Relations between China and Turkey have been strained over Turkish reports that Uighurs were banned from worshipping and fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. China expressed displeasure after Turkey this week took in 173 Uighur refugees from Thailand.
