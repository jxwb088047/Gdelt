Uighurs deported by Thailand were on way to join jihad: Beijing
Beijing: Beijing has claimed that the 100 Uighur Muslims, who were deported by Thailand after fleeing China, were on their way to join the fight in the Middle East and some had been implicated in terror activities at home.
A report published on China's official news agency, Xinhua, said that a police investigation had uncovered several gangs recruiting people for jihad and accused Turkish diplomats in some Southeast Asian countries of facilitating illegal movement of people, reported Fox News.
It also claimed that many of the 109 Uighurs had been radicalised by materials sent by the exiled World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based rights group, and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which has been designated by China as a terrorist organization.
Thailand's decision to extradite over 100 Uighur Muslims to China was met with fierce criticism from human rights groups, with activists saying that they could face possible persecution in the country.Â
