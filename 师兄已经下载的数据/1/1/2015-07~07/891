Thai Gov't Spokesman Confirms 90 Uighur 'sent Back' To China | Fulton News
– Human Rights Watch spokesperson tells Anadolu Agency ‘if true’ act is clear violation of int’l law as Uighur could face serious human rights abuses

BANGKOK – A deputy-spokesman for the Thai government has said that 90 Uighur who were detained in Thailand have been “sent back” to China.
Major General Weerachon Sukhonthapatipak confirmed in an interview with Thai Radio 105MHZ that the 90 were returned to China early Wednesday, without giving more details.
“We are still trying to find out details, but if confirmed it is a clear violation of the international law as the Uighur could face serious human rights abuses in China,” Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch representative in Thailand, told Anadolu Agency 
 “Thai authorities have often shown very little regard for humanitarian considerations when sending back people where they could face rights violations, as has been the case in the past for Rohingya or Hmong.”
Overnight, crowds were reported to have gathered outside of the Thai consulate in Istanbul as news broke that the Uighur were about to be deported.
Some were reported to have broken into the building, from where they smashed windows and lowered the Southeast Asian country’s flag.
