Iran Signs Historic Nuke Deal | Foreign Policy Journal
The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur calls the Iran deal, “Fantastic!” and slams Conservatives.
The Young Turks Network — The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur calls the Iran deal, “Fantastic!” and slams Conservatives. Uygur attacks the right-wingers who negatively reacted to the deal, “You should all be thrilled Iran won’t get nuclear weapons.” Uygur responds to Conservative banter including their argument that the US is soft on money with Iran, “No, no, no, that was their assets, we froze them…it was [Iran’s] money, we kidnapped it and held it hostage in order to get this deal.” Conservative criticism make no sense because without the deal the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia would end up in a war against Iran.
He adds that countries like Russia, China, and Germany also agree to the deal. He brings up that the United States and Israel get to keep their nuclear program while Iran ends their program. Uygur explains that Iran can’t inspect the US military sites but the United Nations can inspect Iran’s sites.
Uygur points out that Iran hasn’t started any wars in the Middle East, “Oh right, we started those wars.” “We won the deal,” Uygur says. The alternative to the deal would have been war. He adds that the right-wing is mad because, ‘We didn’t get to kill anybody today.’ Uygur hits back at Republicans, “Nothing’s ever good enough.”
