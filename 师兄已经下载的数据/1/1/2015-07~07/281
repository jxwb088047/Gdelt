As a heat wave continues to scorch Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which has topped the list of the hottest places in China for more than a week, Xinjiang people said the difference between them and a steak thrown on a barbecue is a pinch of salt.
"You can literally feel your skin sizzling under the sun. My wife reminded me to bring salt and pepper with me and rotate myself properly so I can be roasted evenly. I know she was just joking, but it's been too hot for too long," said Wang Liyuan, an Urumqi resident. The temperature in the regional capital of Urumqi reached a record 41 C on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the Xinjiang Meteorological Department issued red heat warnings to cities around the region for the seventh day. People in seven of the 16 major cities in the region experienced temperatures over 40 C on Wednesday.
