In Xinjiang, Muslims are currently observing Ramadan, a holy month of spiritual reflection and fasting. We head to the ancient city of Kashgar, in southern Xinjiang, to see what the atmosphere is like there. 
Kashgar, China's western most city is where Islam was introduced to china some 1000 years ago.
At about 6 AM, in Xinjiang's largest mosque Id Kah, Muslims begin their first prayer of the day before the sunrise.
"During Ramadan, all Muslims here have the freedom to choose whether to fast or not. They can do their five prayers a day at mosques or at home or at their business places. It’s up to them," said Abadula Memeti, a mosque hatip.
The Id Kah mosque, when there are no prayers, is open to tourists. Its surroundings, the Kashgar old town, dates back 2,000 years, and is home to 200 000 people.
Kashgar, China's western most city is where Islam was introduced to china some 1000 years ago. Today, Muslims.
Arin Raji, one of the old town’s residents, is observing Ramadan. The retiree spends his day making a wool hat, which he’ll then sell to one of the tourists visiting the city.
"These years, Kashgar has developed well and that makes me happy. I really hope the city gets even better and becomes even more known around the world," said Raji.
Since 2010, 7 billion yuan have been spent to renovate the old town. Now it's a scenic spot, featuring Uygur architecture and handicrafts. 
"At first many local residents didn't want their hundred year old houses to be renovated. But after renovation, they found their houses were safer and life was more convenient, they were happy," said Cartier, an official of Kashgar old town.
The scenic spot is open during the Ramadan, and so are the businesses within. 
Once a key staging post on the ancient Silk Road trading route, Kashgar is still attracting businessmen looking to engage in for cross- border business today.
"Kashgar is close to central Asian countries. China is reviving the Silk Road. I'm planning to open a trading company based in Kashgar, trading clothes and light industrial products," said Xia Wenhui, a businessman.
Arin Raji hopes more tourists from the world over will come to his city to discover its beauty, and to buy his hats.
