​Turkish President Erdogan visits China | gbtimes.com
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has arrived in Beijing for his first state visit to China, aiming to improve bilateral ties, according to state-run Global Times. The Turkish media Daily Sabah reported that the two countries's leaders will hold talks on trade relations and issues pertaining to Xinjiang's Muslim Uyghurs, as well as Turkey’s proposals to purchase Chinese long-range missile systems. Accompanied by over 100 business leaders, Erdogan is expected to attend Thursday's China-Turkey Economic and Trade Forum. China has become Turkey’s second largest trade partner, with trade volume between the two countries hitting over $20 billion for three consecutive years. His visit comes after protests in Istanbul and Ankara over reports that Muslim Uyghurs in China’s Xinjiang province were banned from fasting during the Ramadan.   The BBC reports that Turkey's border crisis with Syria has given renewed impetus to its on-again-off-again deal to buy a long-range missile system.
