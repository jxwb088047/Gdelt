OBAMA RETURNS TO KENYA - Reunites With Father\'s Family in Kenya

 President Barack Obama struck a personal note as he returned to his father\'s homeland Kenya this weekend, openly embracing his extended family during his first visit as commander and chief.

\"There\'s a reason why my name is Barack Hussein Obama,\" he said on Saturday at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi on Saturday. \"My father came from these parts and I have family and relatives here, and in my visits over the years walking the streets of Nairobi I\'ve come to know the warmth and spirit of the Kenyan people.\"

Obama fulfilled the hopes of millions of Kenyans when he visited Kenya Friday. It is the first such visit by a sitting president, and a long sought visit by a country that considers him a local son. \"I don\'t think that Kenyans think of Obama as African-American. They think of him as Kenyan-American,\" said EJ Hogendoorn, deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group. President Obama late Saturday joked about the controversy surrounding former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton’s use of a private email account during a white-tie dinner in Washington, D.C.

According to a White House pool report, Obama told guests at the Gridiron Club dinner that he was once known as the young, tech-savvy candidate.

But now, “Hillary has a server in her house! I didn’t even know ...

Barack Hussein Obama, Sr. (/ˈbærək huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/; 18 June 1936 − 24 November 1982) was a Kenyan senior governmental economist and the father of U.S. President Barack Obama. He is a main subject of his son's memoir, Dreams from My Father.
Obama Sr. was born in Rachuonyo District on the shores of Lake Victoria just outside Kendu Bay, Kenya Colony, at the time a colony of the British Empire. He was raised in the village of Nyang’oma Kogelo, Siaya District, Nyanza Province. His family are members of the Luo ethnic group. His father was Onyango (later Hussein) Obama (c. 1895-1979) and his mother was Habiba Akumu Nyanjango of Karabondi, Kenya, Hussein Onyango's second wife. However, Barack Obama Sr. was raised by his father Hussein's third wife, Sarah Ogwel of Kogelo, after his mother Akumu separated from her husband Hussein and left her family in 1945.
Before working as a cook for missionaries in Nairobi, Barack Obama Sr.'s father Onyango had traveled widely, enlisting in the British colonial forces and visiting Europe, India, and Zanzibar, where he converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam and took the name Hussein. Hussein Onyango was jailed by the British for six months in 1949 due to his involvement in the Kenyan independence movement. According to Barack Obama Sr.'s stepmother, Sarah Onyango Obama, Hussein was subjected to beatings and abuse which caused permanent physical disabilities and a loathing of the British.
