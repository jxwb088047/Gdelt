China wanted Thailand to return all Uighurs

 Beijing's request was denied based on the grounds that the 
Uighurs' nationalities had to be "verified" by Thai authorities 
first, Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, deputy Thai 
government spokesman, told reporters.

 "This decision was difficult to make. It is not like all of 
a sudden China asks for Uighurs and we just give them back. China asked for all Uighur Muslims in Thailand to be sent back 
but we said we could not do it," he said.

 More than 170 Uighurs were identified as Turkish citizens 
and sent to Turkey from Thailand over the past month, said 
Colonel Weerachon, while nearly 100 were sent back to China. Fifty 
others still need to have their citizenship verified.
