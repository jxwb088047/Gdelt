China: Top Security Official Probed For Corruption | Fulton News
– Former head of prison system in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region under investigation for alleged corruption

BEIJING – A former head of the prison system in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is being investigated for graft.
The South China Morning Post reported Wednesday that Xie Hui, a deputy regional security chief, was being probed on “suspected serious breaches in discipline”.
The report was attributed to a statement issued by the Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. 
No further details were given about the investigation, although “suspected serious breaches in discipline” is often used by the Party as a euphemism for corruption.
Xie was in charge of the Xinjiang prison system from 2010 until his promotion in 2013 to deputy head of the Xinjiang public security bureau.
Xinjiang — home of the Muslim Uighur ethnic group that constitutes around 45 percent of the population — has been beset by violence in recent years
While the government blames the violence on extremists, rights groups have blamed the government for policies they say controls Uighur religion and culture.
