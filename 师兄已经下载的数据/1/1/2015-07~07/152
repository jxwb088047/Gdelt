Mayor invites Uighurs fleeing China - Daily Sabah

Özlem Çerçioğlu, the mayor of western city of Aydın, announced on Friday that her municipality would provide accommodation and jobs for 100 Uighur families if the Foreign Ministry accepts them. She said China has been oppressing "our Uighur brothers" and prevented their universal right of practicing their faith. "The people of Aydın are hospitable and sensitive to the plight of others. Thus, we would like to provide shelter for 100 Uighur families and jobs for breadwinners of families," she said. Çerçioğlu said they would receive Uighurs if the Foreign Ministry helps their relocation to Turkey from China. Kayseri, a town in central Turkey, is already home to dozens of Uighur families who fled persecution in China. Earlier this week, 173 Uighurs kept in detention in Thailand arrived in Turkey and were accommodated in Kayseri, where they live in a neighborhood exclusively set up for Uighurs.
