The Republican party is in a lot of trouble with Latino voters, the Hispanic vote provided gigantic leads to President Barack Obama in both of his Presidential elections. After 2012 some Republicans tried to reverse this downward trend. A great way to reach out to Hispanic voters would be to attend the upcoming national La Raza convention, can you guess how many of the 2016 Republican hopefuls will be there? Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The nation’s largest Latino advocacy group says it invited every presidential candidate to annual convention next week. Not a single Republican plans to attend, a spokesman said.
Democrats Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Martin O’Malley, former governor of Maryland, will appear at a lunch Monday in Kansas City, Mo., before the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy and civil rights organization for Latinos. Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont originally had a conflict but now plans to appear as well, his spokesman said.”*
