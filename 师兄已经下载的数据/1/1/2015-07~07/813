Rivals Pakistan and India to start joining China security bloc
India and Pakistan would be joining hands to join security bloc led by China and Russia at a summit that would be held in Russia later in this week. This was a project that was planned since 2001 and now it is on the verge of getting implemented. The observer countries would be India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and Mongolia while the Shanghai cooperation would include China, Russia and the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
More countries would now be joining the SCO development- Chinese vice Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping told a news briefing. India and Pakistan would be playing an important role in the SCO development. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and they are well known rivals to each other.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be in Moscow for a summit of emerging markets and he and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, would be attending a special SCO â€œoutreach session as well. The grouping was made to fight the threats incurred by Islam and drug trafficking from neighboring Afghanistan.
The summit would also be attended by the Chinese President Xi Jinping. China said that Uighur militants, who have been operating as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, have also been working with Islamic State. The summit would have close security as well.
