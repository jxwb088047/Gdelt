In the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, Rupert Murdoch has been accused of corrupting British media and contaminating politics. Yet the caricature image of him as the \'Dirty Digger\', the sinister head of a global media empire, in fact obscures deeper, more significant truths - not least about Britain itself.

Rupert Murdoch can be seen as an agent of change, a revolutionary almost, who has been a vital part of the transformation of Britain over the last 45 years. He rode the wave of social change that swept a gloomy postwar country into the modern world and his ability to understand what people wanted and give it to them made him rich and powerful. Yet his part in this cultural, political and industrial revolution also brought Rupert Murdoch into conflict with the establishment and vested interests in all their guises. It may even have ultimately cost him his life\'s ambition - to see the business he has built carried on inside the family by one of his children. Steve Hewlett tells the story of Rupert Murdoch\'s 40-year battle with Britain....

Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall followed up their nuptials with a blessing at St Bride\'s Church in Fleet Street, the Journalists’ Church, this morning.

The location might seem ironic to those in the industry as it was Murdoch who in the \'80s moved his printing presses to Wapping, thus ending a traditional relationship between the media and its \'spiritual home.\'

The list of guests could be seen as a \'who’s who\' of key individuals who wield real political, financial and cultural power over people.

Alan Yentob – Resigned as BBC Creative Director after allegations he tried to influence the coverage of the Kids Company scandal, a charity of which he was Chairman.

Rebekah Brooks – Perhaps best known as one of the accused, along with ex lover and Cameron\'s ex Communications Director Andy Coulson, in the hacking scandal. Media was accused of hacking into the phones of celebrities and people like murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler for stories. Brooks has been cleared and is now running News UK, UK arm of Murdoch\'s global media empire.

Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild – Of the multibillion banking dynasty with interests in oil and energy, current tenant of Spencer House, the London Palace owned by Earl Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, where his close friend Rupert married Jerry Hall yesterday.

Priti Patel – Tory Minister for Employment who wants to be leader and, logic follows, one day PM, also part of the EU \'Out\' camp of the Cabinet along with Michael Gove and IDS, mastermind of the much-revil...

What you are told in the mainstream media, is the exact same agenda being pushed by politicians and the New World Order. The proof can be seen in this video how just one of these megalomaniacs has traded power with different politicians through the DECADES. Bombarding the public with what they are told to believe, and for most that use the TV as trusted source of information - it works. They believe that to control the media is to control your opinion and even your mind. This is true because many take news as fact and pass it around.. promote it.. defend it.. with no thought that they are fuelling a political agenda and a pack of lies. Look at those at the top who control the media, they are the same breed as those who corrupt within governments and through secret societies. For decades, Australian-born billionaire, SIS Agent and Freemason (Knight of Malta) Rupert Murdoch has used the US government\'s increasingly lax media regulations to consolidate his hold over the media and wider political debate in America. Consider Murdoch\'s empire: According to Businessweek, \"his satellites deliver TV programs in five continents, all but dominating Britain, Italy, and wide swaths of Asia and the Middle East. He publishes 175 newspapers, including the New York Post and The Times of London. In the US, he owns the Twentieth Century Fox Studio, Fox Network, and 35 TV stations that reach more than 40% of the country...His cable channels include fast-growing Fox News, and 19 regional sports channels. In all, as many as one in five American homes at any given time will be tuned into a show N...

Keith Rupert Murdoch, AC, KSG (born 11 March 1931) is an Australian American media mogul. Murdoch became managing director of Australia's News Limited, inherited from his father, in 1952. He is the founder, Chairman and CEO of global media holding company the News Corporation, the world's second-largest media conglomerate.
In the 1950s and '60s, he acquired various newspapers in Australia and New Zealand, before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969, taking over the News of the World followed closely by The Sun. He moved to New York in 1974 to expand into the US market and became a naturalised US citizen in 1985. In 1981, he bought The Times, his first British broadsheet.
In 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, he consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping, causing bitter industrial disputes. His News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989) and The Wall Street Journal (2007). He formed BSkyB in 1990 and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television. By 2000 Murdoch's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries with a net worth of over $5 billion.
