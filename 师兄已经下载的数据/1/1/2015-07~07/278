Why did Turkey shoot down a Russian plane? You can find out why where. The truth revealed of why Turkey shot down the Russian SU24 over Syria and why the MSM will cover it up and not give you the facts. This event could be the start of world war 3 unless we immediately expel Turkey from NATO and stop supporting extremists in Syria. Turkey have been buying oil from ISIS and should not be allowed to get away with shooting down a Russian fighter plane as punishment for the Russians destroying terrorist ISIS oil tankers that were heading to Turkey to sell their oil.

Look up the ( Qatar -thru - Turkey Oil Pipeline) being built.
That pipeline is meant to make Saudi Arabia the primary petroleum supplier of Europe.
Europe is the #2 Petroleum consumer on earth.
Russia currently supplies Europe with over 80% of its petroleum and natural gas needs thru a pipeline that runs through the Ukraine.
Iran Supplies the remaining amount thru a pipeline from Iran through turkey...

Now with that knowledge, look at how each government is aligning .

They are aligning exactly as you would expect if all of this is about replacing Russia\'s pipeline with Saudi\'s.

Also note, Saudi is the cheapest oil on earth at the moment

DOUBLE DEALING TYRANT WHO\'S SABOTAGING THE WEST\'S BATTLE TO CRUSH ISIS: Turkey\'s Erdogan seems to be doing almost everything he can to cripple the forces actually fighting ISIS - BY MICHAEL BURLEIGH, 26 Nov - [...] In his obsession with removing Syria’s President Assad, Erdogan has ignored the way ISIS has quietly infiltrated dingy and depressed Turkish towns through which they funnel foreign jihadists to Syria. Turkish smugglers buy ISIS oil by the tanker load.
Worrying numbers of young Turks, including members of the youth wing of Erdogan’s AKP party, now support ISIS. In the aftermath of the ISIS attack on Paris, Turkish football fans booed during the minute’s silence for victims at a match in Istanbul between Turkey and Greece. There were even cries of ‘Allahu Akbar’ — the Islamic phrase meaning ‘God is greater’.
Before this year’s elections, ISIS launched two bomb attacks in Turkey on Kurdish rallies in Suruc in July and Ankara in October, killing 134 people in total.
Yet despite this, 7 per cent of Turks do not regard ISIS as terrorists, and more than 15 per cent say they are not a threat to Turkey.
Erdogan’s deep fear is not ISIS, but rather 40 million Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran who might coalesce into a single new state.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (IPA: [ɾeˈd͡ʒep tajˈjip ˈæɾdoan]; born 26 February 1954) has been Prime Minister of Turkey since 2003 and is chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which holds a majority of the seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Erdoğan served as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He graduated in 1981 from Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Commercial Sciences. Erdoğan was also a semi-professional footballer from 1969 to 1982.
Erdoğan was elected Mayor of Istanbul in the local elections of 27 March 1994. He was banned from office and sentenced to a prison term for reciting a poem during a public address in the province of Siirt on 12 December 1997. The poem was allegedly quoted from a book published by a state enterprise and one that had been recommended to teachers by the Ministry of Education. After six months in prison, Erdoğan established the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) on August 14, 2001. From its first year, the AK Party became the largest publicly-supported political movement in Turkey. In the general election of 2002 the AK Party won nearly two-thirds of the seats in parliament, forming the first single-party government for 9 years.
