Police in the southwestern border province of Yunnan released a report showing that law enforcement there shot four people who were illegally crossing the border in the past year and a half.
They also stopped more than 550 people attempting to flee the country during the same time. Bordering Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, Yunnan province is a popular route for people sneaking across borders. The last week has seen several terrorism-related cases pop up in China.
Authorities detained nine tourists from South Africa, Britain and India for watching terrorist propaganda videos. On Monday, police in the northeastern city of Shenyang shot dead three terrorist suspects and wounded another during an anti-terrorism raid.
On the same day in Indonesia, three Chinese Uyghurs were each sentenced to six years in prison for trying to join an Islamic extremist group.
The verdict in Indonesia came on the heels of the repatriation by Thailand of 109 illegal immigrants back to China. Some of them were said to have planned to travel to Turkey and from there enter Syria and Iraq to take part in those country's conflicts.
