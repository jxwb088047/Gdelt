China asks Turkey to explain statement on Uighurs

 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Beijing had demanded that Ankara clarify the matter after the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Turkey's "deep concerns" about the restrictions were relayed to the Chinese ambassador.

 In a mildly worded statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the Turkish public was "saddened" by reports of the restrictions.

 Uighurs complain that the ruling Communist Party forbids fasting by party members, civil servants, teachers and students during Ramadan.
