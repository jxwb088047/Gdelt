Florida Gun Shop Now “Muslim Free Zone"
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 21, 2015Leave a Comment
There’s a store down in Florida called “Florida Gun Supply.” It’s owner is Andrew Hallinan, who decided to put out a video online proclaiming his establishment a “Muslim-free zone.” The parallels in the arguments between this neo-Confederate and the new-atheist movement are striking. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Andrew Hallinan, who declared his Florida Gun Supply shop a “Muslim-free zone” after a Kuwait-born gunman killed four Marines and a sailor in Chattanoooga, Tenn., last week.
“I’m declaring Florida Gun Supply as a Muslim-free zone,” he said in a video posted to Facebook. “I will not arm and train those who wish to do harm to my fellow patriots…”
Hallinan admitted he cannot realistically ask the religious background of every customer that comes through his store, but he does intend to use the power vested in him by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to weed out certain customers, because, as he told the host, “Islam is evil at its core.” He added: “The Koran is built to establish a one-world order, a caliphate.””*
