Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan headed for China Wednesday having secured NATO's backing for Ankara's fight against ISIS militants, but facing tensions with Beijing over China's mostly Muslim Uighur minority.Erdogan -- who meets Chinese President Xi Jinping Wednesday -- in 2009 accused Beijing of "genocide" in the region, and the gap between Chinese and Turkish views of the Uighurs are likely to complicate the discussions.They engaged in a public spat this year over Uighurs who fled China to seek refuge in Thailand, with Turkey offering them shelter against Beijing's wishes. Bangkok said this month that it had deported about 100 Uighurs back to China, after sending more than 170 Uighur women and children to Turkey in late June.
