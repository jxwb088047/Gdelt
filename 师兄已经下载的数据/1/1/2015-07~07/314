Some of the Uighurs deported to China last week from Thailand had planned to go to Syria and Iraq to fight, state television said, showing pictures of them being bundled out of an aircraft with black hoods over their heads.Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs keen to escape unrest in China's western Xinjiang region have traveled clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey.China is home to about 20 million Muslims spread across its vast territory, only a portion of whom are Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language and are from Xinjiang.A senior Chinese police officer said Saturday that some of the Uighurs who reached Turkey were being sold to fight for groups, such as ISIS, as "cannon fodder".China's Foreign Ministry said it had lodged a protest with the United States over its condemnation of the deportations.
