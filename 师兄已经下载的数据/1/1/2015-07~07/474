Thai government officials arrived in China yesterday to report that Uighurs deported from Thailand were treated fairly.
Anusit Kunakorn, head of the National Security Council, led a team to China through Friday in reaction to international condemnation of the Thai government’s repatriation of over 100 Uighur Muslims back to China, where they had fled, claiming persecution.
Thailand may join hands with China to calm all the misperceptions and “misunderstanding” of that decision, according to the head of the Thai delegation.
The two side also confirmed that they will arrange a meeting with representatives from international orgazitions to check Uighurs’ status as soon as possible to ensure their well-being.
The deportation of more than 100 Uighurs from Thailand last week has sparked anger in Turkey, home to a large Uighur diaspora, and deep concern among rights groups and the United States, due to fears they could be mistreated upon their return. The Thai consolate in Istanbul was stormed and trashed.
Earlier this week, The Associated Press cited claims by Chinese officials that the deported immigrants, many of whom were families with women and children, were terrorists on their way to wage war in Turkey, Syria or Iraq and that the Turkish diplomats in some Southeast Asia kingdoms had aided the illegal movement of people.
