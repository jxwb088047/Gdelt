Thai police question Uighur trio over Bangkok blast, AsiaOne Asia News
Experts investigate the Erawan shrine at the site of a deadly blast in central Bangkok, Thailand, August 18, 2015.
BANGKOK - Thai police on Friday said three Uighur Muslims, among dozens detained in the kingdom for illegal entry last year, have been questioned over the deadly Bangkok bombing.





 

Eleven days on from the bombing at Erawan shrine, which killed 20 people and wounded scores more, authorities are hunting for a prime suspect who police describe as a foreign man.
No arrests have been made, despite the circulation of grainy CCTV footage of the lead suspect.
Security analysts have speculated that China's ethnic Uighur minority -- or their co-religious sympathisers -- may have been behind the attack, motivated by Thailand's forced repatriation of more than 100 Uighur refugees last month to an uncertain fate in China.
"Police in (eastern) Sa Kaeo province have questioned three Uighurs," national police chief General Somyot Poompanmoung told reporters in Bangkok on Friday, without giving any further details.
Scores of suspected Uighurs -- a Turkic-speaking minority in China's northwestern Xinjiang region who have long chafed under Chinese control -- were sentenced for illegal entry in Thailand in March 2014.








Bomb blast at Bangkok's Erawan Shrine: Turkish man arrested




1 of 













Two prime suspects in the Erawan Shrine bomb attack that killed 20 and injured more than 100 people re-enacted the crime at 19 key spots in Bangkok.

Adem Karadag, or Bilal Muhammed, who was the first suspect arrested in connection with the August 17 attack in an apartment in Min Buri

and Mieraili Yusufu, the second suspect arrested at the beginning of this month near the Cambodia border at Sa Kaew's Aranyaprathet district, 

were taken to re-enact the crime at key spots where they confessed to committing the crime

Adem's confession was in line with Mieraili's confession and Adem's statements also implicated others in the bombing gang.

Adem started the re-enactment outside the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel where he allegedly got off a tuk-tuk; the second spot was at the Erawan Shrine where Adem placed a bag containing the bomb.



Mieraili was brought to Rama I Road, opposite the Erawan Shrine.

National police chief General Somyot Poompanmuang said the suspects had confessed because they were confronted with evidence.

He said the motive for the bombing was the crackdown on human trafficking, which put an end to the illegal business.

The suspects were part of the human-trafficking ring and might have been hired by an ill-intentioned group to commit the crime.

A foreign man described as a "main suspect" in the deadly Bangkok bombing was arrested, with Thai police calling him an important figure in the network that staged the attack.

The man detained near the border with Cambodia is the second foreigner held over the blast at a religious shrine in central Bangkok which killed 20 people, mostly ethnic Chinese tourists.

Police also said arrest warrants have been issued for three fresh suspects still at large, two of whom have names which appear foreign.

Police probing Thailand's deadliest bombing widened their net in the search for more suspects

after a foreigner was arrested and stacks of fake passports and bomb-making materials were found during a raid on a Bangkok apartment block. 

The 28-year-old man, who has been in Thailand since January 2014, was detained on charges of possessing illegal explosives. 

Police and residents in Bangkok's Nong Chok district said the suspect rented four apartments on the same floor of the rundown building. 

The detained man was reclusive but always appeared focused and walked with intent on his rare forays outside.



Police arrested a foreign man on Saturday they said fitted the description of a suspect seen leaving a rucksack at the site of the Bangkok blast nearly two weeks ago. 

Police raided an apartment in a northern suburb of the capital on Saturday afternoon and discovered possible bomb-making materials that could have been used in the Aug. 17 attack in Bangkok's bustling commercial heart. 

Police say the suspect is ‘unlikely’ international terrorist, but spurred by ‘personal feud’.

Thai police released a sketch of a suspected bomber.

Thai monks led prayers Wednesday for the reopening of Bangkok shrine where a blast killed 20 people, as police hunted a man shown on security footage calmly planting what is believed to be the bomb.

The bomb struck early on Monday evening as worshippers and tourists crowded into the Erawan shrine in the Thai capital's commercial heart, but no-one has yet claimed responsibility.

The unprecedented attack on the Thai capital left at least 11 foreigners dead, with Chinese, Hong Kong, Singaporean, Indonesian and a family from Malaysia among the victims.

More than 100 other people were wounded by a blast that shredded bodies and incinerated motorcycles at one of the city's busiest intersections.

Police said a second explosion at a Bangkok pier on Tuesday that caused no injuries may be linked, deepening fears for Bangkok residents with police conceding they do not know who was responsible.

Around a dozen Buddhist monks led prayers at the Erawan shrine as it re-opened early Wednesday while devotees - including tourists - genuflected and held joss sticks, and AFP reporter said.

A relative of the dead Malaysians had laid bundles of clothes at the shrine to represent the lost loved ones, according to a monk.

The shrine - a popular tourist attraction that typifies the kingdom's unusual blend of Hindu and Buddhist traditions - and its surrounding had already been largely restored.

Twisted iron railings were the only immediate sign of the carnage, which police believe was caused by a bomb made up of three kilogrammes of explosives and ball bearings.

One devotee had more reason than most to give thanks.

Tommy Goh, 56, a Thai-Malaysian from Penang, said only a delayed taxi from his hotel spared him from being at the shrine around the time of the blast.

"Every year I come down to this shrine, we were meant to be here around 6.50-7pm but the taxi didn't arrive from the hotel... so we went somewhere else," he told AFP.

"Ten minutes later and it could have been so different." Police released images Tuesday showing a man, apparently young, slightly built and wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark shorts, walking into the shrine with a backpack.

In the video he calmly places the backpack underneath a bench and then walks away clutching a blue plastic bag and what looks like a smartphone.

The bomb exploded several minutes later, leading Thailand police to make the man their prime suspect.

A small explosion on Tuesday by a bridge at the city's Chaopraya river has been tied to Monday's bomb.

Colonel Kamthorn Ouicharoen, of Thai bomb squad police confirmed the bridge bomb was same type as that detonated at the Erawan Shrine "It's exactly the same, the equipment used to make it, the bomb size," he said.

"Police will resume collecting evidence this afternoon," he added.

Thailand has experienced a near-decade long political crisis that has seen endless rounds of street violence.

But never anything on the scale of Monday's bomb.

A festering insurgency by Muslim rebels in the Thai south has claimed 6,400 victims, but is a highly localised conflict.



A small explosive was thrown from a bridge over the Chao Phraya River in central Bangkok on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported.

The unidentified man threw the explosive near the busy Sathorn Pier on the city’s Chao Phraya River and it landed in a canal.

The incident came a day after a fatal bomb blast at a city shrine.

CCTV footage shows people scattering as they cross the bridge.







The man was filmed on CCTV near the Erewan shrine.

 He was first wearing a backpack, and later appeared without it. 

Thai police are now hunting for him. 

The bomb was reportedly planted inside the Erawan shrine, which is situated just at the corner of the Ratchaprasong intersection and in front of the Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok hotel, an area that many tourists would be familiar with.

A Singaporean woman was killed in the bomb blast that rocked Bangkok's Ratchaprasong area on Monday night, reported local media.

According to a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some Singaporeans were injured in the incident.


MFA said its embassy staff are providing consular assistance to affected Singaporeans.

Dozens of tourists were injured in the bombing, which appeared to have been targeted at foreigners.

MFA urged Singaporeans in Bangkok to take necessary safety precautions, avoid the vicinity of the explosion and to monitor the local news closely

A video has emerged online of a Chinese tourist's first-hand experience of the bomb that exploded at one of Bangkok's most popular shrines on Monday.

Posted on Shanghaiist's Facebook page, the video initially shows a regular scene of pedestrians walking on the sky bridge. 

Then, at the 25th second, there is a sudden loud explosion that rocks the place and balls of fire could be seen.

Screams could be heard in the background and scenes of panic could be seen from the footage.

The male tourist shooting the video could be heard speaking in Mandarin, asking: "What's the situation?"

The bomb was detonated at about 7pm (8pm, Singapore time) in the middle of the city's rush hour, sending a fireball into the sky as commuters and tourists fled in panic.

The bomb was reportedly planted inside the Erawan shrine, which is situated just at the corner of the Ratchaprasong intersection and in front of the Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok hotel, an area that many tourists would be familiar with.

The Erawan is an enormously popular shrine to the Hindu god Brahma but is visited by thousands of Buddhist devotees every day.

It is a major attraction for tourists from East Asia, especially China. Built in 1956, it is one of the Thai capital's top tourist attractions.

National police chief Somyot Poompanmuang told reporters the attack was unprecedented in Thailand.

A bomb on a motorcycle exploded on Monday just outside a Hindu shrine in the centre of the Thai capital, killing at least 12 people, police and a rescue worker said.

The blast was near the Erawan shrine at a major Bangkok intersection, police said.

"All I can say now is there has been an explosion in central Bangkok involving a motorcycle bomb," deputy national police chief Aek Angsananond told Reuters.

He said there had been fatalities, but could not confirm details.

A policeman at the scene and a rescue worker said 12 people had been killed.

Media put the number of the wounded at 20.

A Reuters witness at the scene said she saw pieces of human flesh near the blast site, and a soldier later told onlookers to move back, saying they were checking for a second bomb.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

Thai forces are fighting a low-level Muslim insurgency in the predominantly Buddhist country's south, although those rebels have rarely launched attacks outside their ethnic Malay heartland.

The country has also been riven for a decade by intense and sometimes violent rivalry between political factions in Bangkok and elsewhere.

The army has ruled Thailand since May 2014, when it ousted an elected government after months of, at times, violent anti-government protests.

The Erawan shrine, on a busy corner near top hotels, shopping centres and offices, is a major tourist attraction, especially for visitors from East Asia.

Many ordinary Thais also worship there.

This file photo taken on September 9, 1999 shows tourists paying homage to the Erawan Shrine in central Bangkok.

Thai police have said the bomb was made of 5kg of TNT explosive.

A source said the bomb was hidden under a roadside bench in front of the Erawan shrine.

The explosion had a radius of 40 metres, the source added.

Nation TV reported that the death toll rose to 15.

The homemade bomb was detonated with an electronic circuit.

The TV station said 77 people were injured.

The Red Cross Society issued an urgent plea for the people to donate blood Tuesday as a lot of blood supplies are needed for the victims of the explosion.

Many were found to have entered the kingdom along its eastern border with Cambodia, with the biggest check point in Sa Kaeo province, as others were discovered during a raid on a suspected people-smuggling camp in the kingdom's deep south.
They presented themselves to police as Turkish and were held in detention as Thai authorities determined their nationalities, amid a bitter tussle between Turkey and China over where they should be moved.
Then in July, Thailand suddenly deported 109 Uighurs to China -- a move widely condemned by rights groups and the US over fears for their safety -- while an earlier group of 172 women and children were sent to Turkey.
At the time the Thai junta said around 50 Uighur Muslims remained in immigration detention facilities, as their nationalities were being confirmed.
A Thai police spokesman on Thursday refused to "exclude any possibility" when asked whether Turkish nationals in the country had been questioned over the Bangkok shrine bomb.
Uighurs in Xianjiang, who number around 10 million, have long accused China of cultural and religious repression.
Others have stepped up a domestic campaign of violence -- usually with knife assaults -- but are not known to have ever carried out an attack outside China, or anything as sophisticated as the Erawan blast.
Thai police have so far issued one arrest warrant for the unidentified man suspected of the shrine bombing and a second for a man over a blast the following day near a popular tourist pier, which sent people scurrying but caused no injuries.
A reenactment of the deadly Bangkok blast by Thailand's Nation TV channel has caused an uproar for its insensitivity.
An actor clad in a yellow shirt and wig suspiciously similar to the bomb suspect was spotted by Twitter user @BoyOfHeaven near the Erawan shrine.
According to Channel NewsAsia, people at the shrine were cursing at the actor. He was later asked to leave by the police.
The president of Nation Broadcasting Corporation later issued an apology.
"On behalf of Nation TV, I'd like to express my sincere apologies and remorse for our attempt to reenact the scene without thinking about the impact it might have on the feelings of the public, and for a lack of respect for the deceased," Adisak Limprungpatanakij said.
An Australian model-actor had to turn himself in to the police after he was mistaken as the man behind the deadly bombing in Bangkok.
Sunny Burns, 26, who also works as a private English tutor in Thailand, posted a selfie on the day of the bombing to let his parents and friends in Australia know that he is safe.
He also posted a photo of himself at the popular Erawan Shrine - the scene of the Monday night blast - which he visited a few days before, on Instagram, saying that "Thailand is and will always be a safe and friendly place".
Little did he know that his selfie would go viral.
Thai journalist Prasitchai Kumbang had tweeted Burns' photo with security camera footage of the bombing suspect, drawing similarities from both photos.
To clear his name after the tweet went viral, Burns voluntarily turned himself in to the police. He posted a selfie taken while talking with the police, saying that he is not a terrorist but a "ting tong actor".
Subsequent posts describe police investigations taking place, followed by a security camera footage of himself returning from the gym and getting ready to teach his English class when the bombing happened.
"I forgive everyone who spread those horrible rumours about me," he said. However, it is "not a nice feeling being called a terrorist", he added in his last post.
The Thai authorities are still looking for the man seen in CCTV footage leaving his bag at the shrine and walking away just before Monday's deadly explosion.
