The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which lies on the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is being celebrated by Muslims worldwide, including over 23 million living in China. An entire month dedicated to prayer, fasting and self-reflection, observing Ramadan is one of the pillars of the Muslim faith. In Kashgar, of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Muhammad Iminjan and his 85-year-old father wake up early to prepare for morning prayer. The local Mosque has already filled with fellow Muslims. As day breaks, the prayer finishes, and another business day begins.Muhammad Iminjan, Chinese muslim said:"During Ramadan, neighboring shops all stop their businesses for a rest, but my shop is still open. If I feel tired, I close the shop for a while and go back home for a rest, too."Â Ramadan is said to a time for purify the soul, refocus attention on God, and practice self-sacrifice. Fasting is a key part of this ritual, requiring Muslims to only eat between dusk and dawn.Still, many restaurants and shops in Xinjiang, like Muhammad's, have kept their doors open. And many visitors, both Muslims and non, have been drawn to the region.
"We can sell around one thousand strings of roasted meat at lunch time. There are so many visitors from other cities. Although it's Ramadan, we still keep our business running," said a restaurant manager.
"We do practice fasting, but our business continues."Muslims from other countries have also gathered here in Xinjiang to observe the holy month.This year's holy month lasts until July 17th. Its end will be celebrated with a grand feast for family and friends.
