Cenk Uygur (host of The Young Turks) discusses a leaked photo of a disgusting sign inside a Baltimore police van. In light of the death of Freddie Grey the sign is especially wrong. Cenk goes on to discuss comments by a former Baltimore cop discussing the culture of the department. Does this story surprise you? Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Baltimore authorities are investigating after photos emerged appearing to show a sign inside the door of a police van that reads, “Enjoy your ride, cuz we sure will!”
The photos are circulating amid simmering tensions over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, which set off protests and riots in Baltimore this year.
Prosecutors say Gray suffered a critical neck injury in April after being handcuffed and shackled in the back of a Baltimore police transport van that made several stops. Six police officers have been indicted on charges connected to his death.”*
