New Sandy Bland Dash Cam Footage Released - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 23, 2015Leave a Comment
Sandy Bland was a young African-American woman who died in police custody after being arrested for a turn signal violation. New footage has now been released showing the lead up to her arrest. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The video of Sandra Bland’s arrest, shot from the dashboard camera inside a police cruiser, shows a contentious confrontation between the officer and the woman who died three days later in a Texas jail cell.
In the video of the July 10 incident, released by the Texas Department of Public Safety on Tuesday afternoon, Bland and Texas State Trooper Brian T. Encinia engage in an argument that escalates until Bland is forcefully arrested and charged on suspicion of assaulting a public servant.”*
