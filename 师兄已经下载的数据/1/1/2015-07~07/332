The folded piece of paper with a photo of a four-month-old baby tells a story that will loom over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his Chinese hosts when he visits Beijing this week. Baby Arife is a Uighur. The baby is one of thousands of members of China’s Turkic language-speaking Muslim ethnic minority who have reached Turkey, mostly since last year. The exodus of Uighurs infuriates Beijing, which accuses Ankara of helping its citizens flee unlawfully. Turkish officials deny playing any direct role in assisting the flight. But the document, labeled \"Republic of Turkey Emergency Alien\'s Travel Document\" suggests otherwise. In a statement on July 6th, China\'s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman said there was no such thing as a Uighur \"problem\" in China.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing on Tuesday during an official visit to boost business and political ties between the two rising economic powers, despite differences over Syria and China\'s ethnic Uighur region.
Later, Erdogan met Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping.
The official Xinhua News Agency said Erdogan brought a delegation of 300 businessmen, seeking more Chinese investment in Turkey and an increase in Turkish exports.
The visit is the first to China in 27 years by a Turkish premier and follows a February trip by Xi to Ankara and Istanbul, where the countries signed deals worth (b) billions of dollars.
China\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Erdogan first stopped in Urumqi, capital of the far west Xinjiang region, on Sunday. Xinjiang is home to China\'s Uighurs, who are ethnically related to Turks.
Ethnic tensions have led to violence in the region in recent years, and relations between the countries dipped in 2009 when renewed violence broke out in Xinjiang and Erdogan described China\'s use of overwhelming force against anti-government protesters as a type of genocide.

Many news reports on China’s alleged restrictions on Muslim Uighurs during the holy month of Ramadan do not reflect reality, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said, amid anti-Chinese demonstrations by Turkish nationalists over the treatment of the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim minority in China’s Xinjiang region.
 
Delivering a speech at a fast-breaking dinner where he hosted ambassadors in the Turkish capital Ankara late on July 9, Erdoğan recalled that he was due to visit China in the coming days, and described the timing of recent incidents related to Beijing’s treatment of Uighurs as “meaningful.”

“We have kin in every corner in the world. From the Balkans to Central Asia, from Crimea to North Africa. All incidents, which take place in every single region, directly concern us. So claims about China’s pressure on our siblings in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region lead to sensitivity in our public,” he added.

“However, to a great extent the images and reports circulating in the media have made this sensibility prone to exploitation, deliberately or not,” Erdoğan said.

His words come amid a spike in attacks agains East Asian tourists in Turkey. Earlier on July 9, an Asian tourist was attacked by pro-Uighur protesters in Ankara as they assumed that she was Chinese.

Hours after Erdoğan delivered his speech, Thailand on July 10 closed its embassy and consulate in Turkey after a protest against its deportation of Uighur Muslims to China. The temporary closure of Thailand’s embassy in Ankara and consulate in Istanbul comes after anti-Chinese demonstrators stor...
