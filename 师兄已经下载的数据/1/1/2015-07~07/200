2015-07-14Â Thailand Repatriating Illegal Chinese Immigrants
Experts say Thailand's recent repatriation of over 100 illegal immigrants to China conforms with international practices and the rules of the two countries.
Thailand last week deported 109 people to China, who are mainly from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The Chinese foreign ministry has strongly opposed politicization of the move as some of the immigrants had plans to join the Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq.
Among them, 13 had fled China after being implicated in terrorist activities and another two had escaped detention.
So is the Thai government's move justified? And what are international practices in terms of dealing with the growing threat of homegrown terrorism?
