Uighur expulsion puts strain on Turkey's ties with China, Thailand - Cihan

Turkey's relations with China and Thailand have soured after the Thai expulsion of Uighurs back to China, as diplomatic officials are engaged in a war of words over the sensitive issue, with Thailand seeking to defuse international criticism of its decision.Thailand scrambled to defend itself in the face of a barrage of criticism over its deportation of nearly 100 Uighur Muslims to China, saying it had rejected a request from Beijing to return all the Uighur migrants held in its detention camps.The deportation of the Uighurs has sparked protests in Turkey. Police used tear gas on Thursday to disperse about 100 protesters at the Chinese Embassy in the capital Ankara after they knocked down a barricade and protesters attacked Thailand's honorary consulate in İstanbul late on Wednesday, smashing windows and breaking in.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha earlier raised the possibility of shutting the Thai embassy in Ankara, but on Friday stressed the need for good ties with both Turkey and China. "Thailand and Turkey are not rivals and we do not want to destroy trade and commerce with Turkey," Prayuth said in Bangkok. "At the same time, we do not want to destroy the relationship between China and Thailand." Later on Friday, Thai officials announced that Thailand had temporarily closed its embassy in Ankara. The deportations have drawn condemnation from the United States and human rights groups and sparked sometimes violent protests in Turkey, home to a large Uighur diaspora. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, speaking to ambassadors at an iftar dinner at the presidential palace in Ankara on Thursday night, criticized the expulsion of Uighurs. He said Turkey is committed to acting in solidarity with Uighur Muslims, saying that he planned to raise the plight of the Uighurs during his coming trip to China, according to local media. The Turkish Foreign Ministry also condemned the expulsion of Uighurs in a statement on Thursday. "Non-refoulement is a fundamental principle of international law which is applicable not only for refugees or persons having similar status, but for everyone whose right to life may be violated or subjected to torture in case they are returned forcefully by way of deportation or repatriation," the Foreign Ministry statement said, addressing the risks that Uighurs who were sent back to China would face. The United States condemned the deportations and asked Thailand to stop them, saying the Uighurs could face harsh treatment in China, State Department spokesman John Kirby said."We strongly urge the government of Thailand, and other governments in countries where Uighurs have taken refuge, not to carry out further forced deportations of ethnic Uighurs," Kirby said in a statement. He also urged China to ensure proper treatment of the Uighurs.China accused "some foreign governments and forces" of trying to exploit the Uighur issue for their own ends and said it was "cooperating normally" with Thailand to curb illegal immigration.Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, deputy Thai government spokesman, said Bangkok, in line with "international agreement and international law," had to verify the nationality of all the Uighur migrants case by case before deciding their fate."It is not like all of a sudden China asks for Uighurs and we just give them back. China asked for all Uighur Muslims in Thailand to be sent back but we said we could not do it," he told reporters.Thailand has already identified more than 170 Uighurs as Turkish citizens and sent them to Turkey over the past month, said Weerachon, while nearly 100 were sent back to China. Fifty others still need to have their citizenship verified.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) strongly urged China to ensure proper treatment of the Uighurs.On Friday, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the Uighurs faced "grim" maltreatment back in China."Thailand should make it clear it won't further violate international law by immediately announcing a moratorium on additional deportations of Turkic people to China," said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.Turkey has vowed to keep its doors open to Uighur migrants fleeing persecution in China. Some Turks see themselves as sharing a common cultural and religious heritage with their Uighur "brothers" and Turkey is home to a large Uighur diaspora. Erdoğan slams protesters for violenceThe Uighur issue has strained relations between China and Turkey ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by Turkish President Erdoğan.President Erdoğan criticized some recent attacks on Asian tourists in Turkey, saying the attackers betrayed Turkey's "most ancient tradition" of hospitality.Erdoğan, clearly keen to assuage Beijing's concerns, suggested the protests might have been aimed at damaging his China trip, when he plans to raise the Uighurs' plight.In comments late on Thursday to foreign ambassadors based in Ankara, Erdoğan branded some media coverage of the deportations as "lies or exploitative" and said of the protests, "These provocative incidents do not become us.""Claims of suppression against Uighurs in the autonomous Xinjiang region in the People's Republic of China has stirred national sensitivity in Turkey. Some unfounded reports and disinformation disseminated in the media made this sensitivity susceptible to exploitation," Erdoğan said, adding that "some undesirable incidents in İstanbul that we never want to see took place." China disturbed by international criticismChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying hit back at Beijing's critics at a daily news briefing on Friday."We have noticed that some foreign governments and forces have abused the facts and called these illegal immigrants, without any basis, refugees. They have unscrupulously criticized the normal law cooperation between China and Thailand on the issue of fighting illegal immigration," she said.The Global Times, an influential tabloid published by China's ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, said those deported were "illegal immigrants" or members of gangs involved in people smuggling."Many among them planned to reach Turkey through Southeast Asian countries and then head to Syria and Iraq to participate in terrorist groups," the Global Times added.The allegation came 10 days after Turkey accepted 173 Uighurs from refugee camps in Thailand. The Thai government had said those people were Turkish citizens, but it sent an additional 109 Uighurs back to China on Thursday saying they had only Chinese documentation. The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment.Beijing denies the accusations of human rights groups that it restricts the Uighurs' religious freedoms. It blames militants for a rise in violent attacks in Xinjiang in the past three years in which hundreds have died.(Cihan/Today's Zaman)
