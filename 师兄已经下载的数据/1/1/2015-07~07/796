Trump's Sexist Attack On Breast-Feeding Mom
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJuly 30, 2015Leave a Comment
Back when Donald Trump was being sued on one of his many real estate projects, he was very offended when one of the lawyers excused herself to go pump milk for her baby in another room. Not one to mince words, reports say trump called the woman, “disgusting.” Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The lawyer, Elizabeth Beck, said she needed to pump her breast milk. Trump’s attorney said she was trying to delay proceedings. And Trump straight-up insulted her on the record, because the man who desperately wants to be a politician is, it seems, literally unable to stop himself.
When the lawyer, Elizabeth Beck, asked for a medical break, Mr. Trump and his lawyers objected, demanding that the deposition continue. Ms. Beck said it was urgent — she needed to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter, and she took the pump out to make her point.
“You’re disgusting,” he told Ms. Beck, in a remark that is not disputed by either side. He then walked out of the room, ending the testimony for the day.
Donald Trump—an adult male baby with the combover and personality of a 30 pound toddler—is grossed out by breast milk. What a world!”*
