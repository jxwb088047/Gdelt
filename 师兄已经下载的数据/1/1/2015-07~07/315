Turkish Travel Documents for Uighur Refugees Looms Over Erdogan's Beijing Visit - International News - AllMediaNY
The folded piece of paper with a photo of a four-month-old baby tells a story that will loom over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his Chinese hosts when he visits Beijing this week. Baby Arife is a Uighur. The baby is one of thousands of members of China’s Turkic language-speaking Muslim ethnic minority who have reached Turkey, mostly since last year. The exodus of Uighurs infuriates Beijing, which accuses Ankara of helping its citizens flee unlawfully. Turkish officials deny playing any direct role in assisting the flight. But the document, labeled "Republic of Turkey Emergency Alien's Travel Document" suggests otherwise. In a statement on July 6th, China's Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman said there was no such thing as a Uighur "problem" in China.
