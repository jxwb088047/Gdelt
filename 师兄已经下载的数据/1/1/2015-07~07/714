Thai police probe Turkish connection in Bangkok blast - Borneo Bulletin Online
BANGKOK (Reuters) – Thai police on Thursday said they were looking at arrivals of Turkish nationals in the days before a Bangkok bomb attack that killed 20 people, but said they had not ruled out any group or possibility.
Police and some security analysts have raised the possibility of a connection to the Uighurs â a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority from the far west of China. They complain of persecution by Beijing.
Chinaâs treatment of the Uighurs is an important issue for many Turks, who see themselves as sharing a common cultural and religious background.
Last month more than 100 Uighurs were deported from Thailand to China â a move that prompted widespread condemnation by rights groups and sparked a protest outside Thailandâs consulate in Istanbul.
National police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri told reporters police had checked arrivals of Turkish nationals who entered Thailand around two weeks before the blast.

âThere are probably more Turkish coming into Thailand than that. We investigated groups which may have come into the country,â said Prawut, in response to whether police had investigated 15 Turkish nationals.
âWe checked, but not 15 people,â Prawut said, adding that police have not ruled out any group or nationality.
âWe are not focused on the nationality but the individual,â he said, without giving further details.
The main evidence police have for the blast at the Hindu Erawan Shrine popular with Asian tourists is security camera footage.
The footage shows a man with a yellow shirt and dark hair removing a backpack after entering the shrine and walking away from the scene before the explosion.
Twelve of the 20 dead in Mondayâs attack were foreigners, including nationals from China, Hong Kong, Britain, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
Anthony Davis, a Bangkok-based security analyst with IHS-Janeâs, speaking at the Foreign Correspondentâs Club of Thailand on Monday, said there were three âlikely groupingsâ which have the motive and the capability to pull off the attack.
The most likely perpetrators of the bombing were militant members of a right-wing Turkish organization called the Grey Wolves, a pan-Turkic, extreme right-wing organisation, he said. Davis said their motive may have been revenge for Thailandâs deportation of ethnic Uighurs to China.
âThe Uighur cause is something theyâve latched onto in a big way,â he said, adding that the Grey Wolves were âat the front of the queueâ during an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul last month by a mob protesting Thailandâs decision to extradite the Uighurs.
