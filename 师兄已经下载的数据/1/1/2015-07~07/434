Muslims around the world are celebrating one of the largest festivals in their calender-year, Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Ramadan.
The holy month -- which is the ninth in the Islamic calendar -- revolves around daily fasting and prayer. Fasting is obligatory for all adult Muslims and those observing it do not eat or drink between dawn and dusk.
The exact date of the Eid al-Fitr festival varies, depending on observations of the new moon by local religious authorities. Northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu provinces started celebrating the festival on Friday, while the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are holding festivities Saturday.
The Eid celebrations last for three days and are a time for family gatherings and exchanging gifts.
