While in Xinjiang, approximately one mosque for every 400 Muslims is designated, Turkey's Presidency of Religious Affairs has stated that there are 82,693 mosques throughout Turkey, which equates to one mosque for nearly 920 Muslims."Underlining that the religious and cultural rights of the minority groups are being protected, while the rights of using their language are being protected, the statement further added that the traditional cultures are being developed. The statement continued by indicating that Xinjiang's National Radio broadcasts in five languages as the television broadcasts in four languages.
