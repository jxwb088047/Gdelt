Turkey should restrain anti-China protests - China.org.cn
Following a protest in Istanbul on Saturday against the alleged "mistreatment of Muslim Uygur people in China", China's embassy in the Turkish capital Ankara has warned its residents traveling in the country to be careful and stay away from the protestors. A group of Korean tourists were reportedly mistaken as Chinese and attacked by the protesters outside the Topkapi Palace.

The anti-China protests are believed to be linked with some Western media's reports that the Chinese government had restricted Muslim Uygurs, the majority of whom live in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, from praying and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.
Although the reports were false, they went viral on some social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter when Ramadan began on June 18, leading to online accusations of China restricting ordinary Muslims from observing Ramadan.
But the truth is, the Xinjiang government convened a special meeting to ensure Muslim people's religious activities during Ramadan were not disturbed. China's Foreign Ministry also asked Chinese tourists to respect religious customs when traveling in Muslim countries in the same month.
Another important fact should also be noted. Six years ago on July 5 the riots in Urumqi of Xinjiang left 197 dead. It should not come as a surprise that some extremists in Turkey would choose the day to generate chaos and vent their anger towards innocent Chinese citizens, especially when the reports about China's "restrictions" emerged.
