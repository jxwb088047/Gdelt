NSC member to visit China to observe how repatriated Uyghurs are treated - Pattaya Mail - Pattaya News, Communities, Opinions and much more...
BANGKOK, 14 July 2015, National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Anusit Kunakorn is scheduled to visit China from July 15 - 17, in order to observe the way the recently repatriated 109 Uyghurs from Thailand are being treated.
The Secretary-General is to meet with officials from China’s Ministry of State Security regarding the matter, in his bid to prevent further misunderstanding about Thailand’s decision to repatriate the migrants. He will seek Chinese authority’s permission to personally observe the treatment of these individuals who are now under the supervision of Chinese officials.
Earlier Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha had said Thai authorities would strictly follow the international humanitarian guidelines when dealing with illegal migrants in the country.
Meanwhile, the Thai embassy in Ankara, Turkey has issued a warning on its Facebook page to all Thais residing in the country to be extra careful when traveling. According to the warning, Turkish locals are still hostile towards Thai as they resent the Thai government's decision to repatriate the 109 Uyghurs to China.
