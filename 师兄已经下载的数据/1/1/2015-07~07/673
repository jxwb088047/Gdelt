More tragic updates on Sandra Bland, but one bit of positive news is that there will now be outside prosecutors working on this. There’s going to be a commission to investigate her death, separate from the local police department. Also, a woman who was in an adjacent cell speaks about Sandy Bland’s final days. Finally, Fox’s Elisabeth Hasselbeck wonders if the cop was afraid of Sandra Bland burning him to death with her cigarette. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The full autopsy for Sandra Bland has been released today, providing more insight into how she ended up dead in jail, after being arrestedduring a confrontation with a police officer. Yesterday the prosecutor said that Bland’s injuries are consistent with suicide, and today the extent of those injuries are now available to the public.
The autopsy notes a white trash bag was used as a ligature, “tied into a slip knot that forms a circle at one end and a knotted area at the opposite end.”
Bland also had 25 to 30 cut marks on her left forearm.”*
