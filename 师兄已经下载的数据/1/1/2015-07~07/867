At Least 4 Civilians Have Been Arrested in TabrizHrana – News Agancy
HRANA News Agency – At least four people were arrested on Qods day’s rally, in Tabriz by the security forces. The arrestee’s names are Rasoul Razavi, Hossain Rakhshanikia and Sevindik Lotfi and the identity of the other one is unknown.
According to the report of Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), these arrests happened after civil rights activists of Tabriz demonstrated their solidarity with Uighur Muslims in China with placards and banners.
Also, in a similar protest in Ahar city, security forces intervened and Ibrahim Nouri and Milad Azimi, two activists were arrested and interrogated for hours.
Reason of these protests has been announced to be the suppression of Uighur minorities by the Chinese government and preventing them from fasting and practicing religious customs and ceremonies in Ramadan month.
Islamic republic of Iran has a very good broad relationship with China, and critics point is the silence of Iran about these suppression, while Iran always presents itself as the defender of all Muslims.
