Tajik foreign minister leaves for visit to China | Tajikistan News-NA «Asia-Plus»
DUSHANBE, July 22, 2015, Asia-Plus /Payrav Chorshanbiyev/ -- Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Aslov left Dushanbe Wednesday afternoon for an official visit to China, according to the Tajik MFA information department.
During the visit that will last until July 25, Aslov is reportedly scheduled to hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, China’s State Council member Yang Jiechi and top managers of China’s National Development and Reform Commission.
The foreign ministers of the two counties are expected to discuss a broad range of issues related to state and prospects of further expansion of bilateral cooperation between their countries.
Tajik foreign minister is also expected to meet with researchers and experts from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and give interview to a number of leading media outlets of China.
China is Tajikistan’s largest creditor.  According to some data, Tajikistan now owes more than 900 million U.S. dollars to China.
The China Development Bank (CDB) is expected to provide a long-term $500 million loan to the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT).  We will recall that a delegation of the CDB, led by Lu Tao, Vice-President of the CDB’s branch in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), was in Dushanbe in early July to discuss the details of providing the loan to the NBT.  The sides reportedly agreed to continue negotiations on this subject in the near future in Beijing.
