Hillary Clinton On Bankster Bribes: "Bernie Did It Too...Kinda" - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiFebruary 9, 2016Leave a Comment
Hillary Clinton was very angry at Senator Bernie Sanders at the most recent Democratic debate. Former Secretary of State Clinton attacked Bernie’s “very artful smears” at the debate. Cenk Uygur host of The Young Turks gets to the bottom of Clinton’s attacks. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“For months, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders seemed to run for president in parallel universes. Clinton focused her criticism on Republicans and rarely targeted Sanders. She did not even say his name in public until long after the first debate. They raced like lap swimmers, each in their own lane.
But with snow settling on New Hampshire and a loss likely in the Granite State on Tuesday, Clinton and her allies have turned their fire on the Vermont senator. In the last weeks, Clinton, her husband Bill, daughter Chelsea, allied super PACs, surrogates and members of Congress have by turns accused Sanders of hypocrisy, inconsistency and cutting corners. The Clintons, well-accustomed to decades of intense scrutiny by Republicans, now are giving Sanders a more thorough appraisal than he has ever had in his career.
Frustrated Clinton aides believe that Sanders is a politician like any other. Sanders has flip-flopped on gun control, Wall Street donations and immigration reform, they say, changing his views when it is politically expedient.”*
