VICE News traveled to Nigeria to embed with the country\'s army as it ramped up its fight against Boko Haram, whose rise has caused a state of emergency. As the only journalists on the front line in northern Nigeria, we witnessed the beginning of the largest military insurgency to date.

Boko Haram’s terror has spread beyond Nigeria’s borders. In mid-June the recently declared Islamic State-affiliate staged two suicide attacks in the Chadian capital N’djamena, killing 23 people. The expanding threat posed by the militant group was answered earlier this year by a regional coalition of forces from Chad, Niger, and Cameroon who agreed to assist Nigeria’s own beleaguered army.

Chad’s contingent of 5,000 soldiers has advanced the furthest into Nigeria. One of the most experienced fighting forces in the region, Chad says they’ve killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants while losing few of their own troops. 

Meanwhile, thousands of refugees and displaced people have sought shelter in Chad’s Lake Region, which houses some of most destitute communities in one of the poorest countries in the world. 

VICE News reported from across the region, speaking to soldiers and refugees.

The far north region of Cameroon is frequently the target of deadly Boko Haram attacks, with the bombings most often perpetrated by suicide bombers. A team of FRANCE 24 journalists embedded with the Cameroonian army report from the front line as the troops battle this hotbed of terrorism in Central Africa.
The region around Maroua, the provincial capital of the far north region of Cameroon, is regularly hit by suicide attacks, including many committed by girls and boys transformed into human bombs in Boko Haram camps in neighbouring Nigeria.
Since the Nigerian Islamists, who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, first attacked Cameroonian territory in 2013, hundreds of people have been killed in attacks and bombings in the far north region.
Preventing jihadists from reaching Cameroon by crossing the porous border has become a crucial mission for the Cameroonian army, which is on the front line to defend the country and prevent the infiltration of suicide bombers.

There has been another Boko Haram massacre. The terrorist group killed 86 in Dalori, Nigeria. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"A survivor hidden in a tree says he watched Boko Haram extremists firebomb huts and heard the screams of children burning to death, among 86 people officials say died in the latest attack by Nigeria\'s homegrown Islamic extremists.

Scores of charred corpses and bodies with bullet wounds littered the streets from Saturday night\'s attack on Dalori village and two nearby camps housing 25,000 refugees, according to survivors and soldiers at the scene just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the biggest city in Nigeria\'s northeast.

The shooting, burning and explosions from three suicide bombers continued for nearly four hours in the unprotected area, survivor Alamin Bakura said, weeping on a telephone call to The Associated Press. He said several of his family members were killed or wounded.”*

Au Cameroun, la région de l\'Extrême-Nord est régulièrement la cible d\'attaques meurtrières de Boko Haram. Les attentats sont souvent perpétrés par des kamikazes, dont des femmes ou des adolescents. Nos reporters ont suivi plusieurs unités de l\'armée camerounaise, et notamment son unité d\'élite en immersion dans ce nouveau foyer terroriste du centre de l\'Afrique. 
À 1 000 km de Yaoundé, la région de Maroua, capitale de la province de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun, vit au rythme des attaques suicides. Ces attaques sont souvent perpétrées par des jeunes filles ou garçons transformés en bombes humaines dans des camps d’enrôlement de Boko Haram, au Nigeria voisin.
Depuis 2013, lorsque les islamistes nigérians, ralliés à l\'organisation de l\'État islamique (EI), ont commencé à attaquer le territoire camerounais, des centaines de personnes ont été tuées dans des attaques et des attentats dans la région de l\'Extrême-Nord. Empêcher les jihadistes de venir frapper au Cameroun en traversant la frontière poreuse est une mission cruciale pour l’armée camerounaise, en première ligne pour défendre le territoire et empêcher l’infiltration des kamikazes.
Pendant cinq jours, nous avons pu partager le quotidien de ces soldats camerounais engagés dans la traque des kamikazes. Sous bonne escorte - une quinzaine d’hommes armés -, nous avons parcouru des centaines de kilomètres de pistes cahoteuses de cette région aride et pauvre, difficile d’accès.

People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad (Arabic: جماعة اهل السنة للدعوة والجهاد, Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati Wal-Jihad), better known by its Hausa name Boko Haram, is a jihadist terrorist organization based in the northeast of Nigeria. It is an Islamist movement which strongly opposes man-made laws. Founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2001 or 2002, the organisation is a Muslim sect that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish sharia law in the country. The group is also known for attacking Christian churches.
The movement, whose name in the Hausa language, Boko Haram, translates as "Western education is sinful" is divided into three factions, and in 2011, was responsible for at least 450 killings in Nigeria.
Though the group first became known internationally following sectarian violence in Nigeria in 2009, it does not have a clear structure or evident chain of command. Moreover, it is still a matter of debate whether Boko Haram has links to terror outfits outside Nigeria and its fighters have frequently clashed with Nigeria's central government.
