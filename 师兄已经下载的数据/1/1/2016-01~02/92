BANGKOK — The suspected mastermind behind the bombing at Bangkok\'s Erawan Shrine last month is thought to have fled to Istanbul via multiple cities, Thai police said Monday.

Thai authorities are searching for a man they believe led the bombing attack at a Bangkok shrine last month that killed 20 people and injured at least 120 others. 

The male suspect, identified as Abu Dustar Abdulrahman, or Izan, is thought to have fled Bangkok and then traveled to Bangladesh, New Delhi and Abu Dhabi, before flying to Istanbul. However, the Turkish government says that it has no record of the suspect having entered Turkey.

Characteristic of the confusing and contradictory nature of the police investigation following the Bangkok bombing, initial police reports said that the suspect fled to China while other reports suggest that Abdulrahman may not be the leader of the bombing attack.

Abdulrahman, along with a second foreign suspect who has been detained, obtained Thai visas in Kuala Lumpur using Chinese passports. The latter man\'s passport indicates that he is from China\'s Xinjiang province. Thai police have been reluctant to connect the bombing suspects to China or China\'s Uighur population even though some of the evidence points to a connection.

Meanwhile, Malaysian police say that they have arrested three people suspected of involvement with the bombing — two of them Malaysian nationals while the third is Pakistani.

A police warrant has been issued for Abdulrahman, who is thought to have fled Thailand on August 16, a day before the bombing.

A bomb has exploded close to a shrine in the centre of Thailand\'s capital, Bangkok, killing at least 16 people and injuring more than 80.
The Erawan Shrine is a major tourist attraction and foreigners, including Chinese, were said to be among the casualties.
No-one has yet said they carried out the attack.
Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwong said the bomb had \"targeted foreigners... to damage tourism and the economy\".
Read the latest updates here
The Nation TV channel quoted Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha as saying the government would set up a \"war room\" to co-ordinate its response.
Nation put the death toll as high as 27, saying at least three foreigners were killed, but there has been no official confirmation.
The explosion occurred at about 19:00 local time (12:00 GMT).
The Bangkok Post quoted police as saying that 3kg of TNT had been stuffed in a pipe inside the shrine and that an electronic circuit suspected to have been used in the attack was found 30 metres from the scene.
Police checked the area for other devices but no further bombs have been found, the paper said.
\'Really graphic\'
The BBC\'s Jonathan Head, who is at the scene, says there is a huge amount of chaos, with body parts scattered everywhere.
He says this is a very well-known shrine in the centre of Bangkok, next to a five-star hotel, and that people around the shrine were hit by the full force of the blast.

Police have arrested a suspect in the Bangkok shrine bombing, according to Thai media reports.
The man was apprehended in the Thai capital with bomb making material, reports said. 
Initial reports said he was believed to be Turkish. A bomb tore through Erawan shrine in central Bangkok on 17 August, killing 20 people and injuring more than 120 others. A second bomb exploded at a river canal in the city the next day.
No-one was injured in that blast.

Thai media have published a photograph of the arrested man alongside a police drawing of a key suspect who left a backpack filled with explosives and ball bearings at the shrine.
In the days following the blast Thai authorities made conflicting and confusing statements about their investigations.
But one theory they pursued was that an ultra-nationalist group in Turkey was behind the bombings.
The violent group known as the Grey Wolves has taken up the cause of Uighur Muslins in China who say they have been long persecuted by Beijing.
Uighurs regard themselves as of Turkish origin. 
Thailand infuriated the Uighur movement when the country deported 109 Uighurs to China in July.
The men were separated from their wives and children.

THAILAND’S prime minister says authorities have arrested a man they believe is the main suspect in a bombing at a shrine in central Bangkok two weeks ago that killed 20 people.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday the man is a foreigner and was arrested in eastern Thailand near the Cambodian border.
He described him as the main person in the bombing but did not directly say he is suspected of actually planting the bomb.
He is believed to the person seen in CCTV footage wearing a yellow shirt and leaving a backpack behind at the shrine.
Thai media on Tuesday widely published a photo of a Chinese passport photo of the arrested man. In the passport, he is named Yusufu Mieraili, 25, from Xinjiang province. Xinjiang is the home province for China\'s Uighur Muslim minority, the Bangkok Post reported.
Speculation has grown that the suspect might be part of a group seeking to avenge Thailand’s forced repatriation of ethnic Uighurs to China in July. Prayuth on Monday suggested the bombers might have been involved in smuggling Uighurs out of China.
Uighurs are related to Turks, and Turkey is home to a large Uighur community.
The Erawan Shrine is especially popular with Chinese tourists, feeding the idea that it could be a target for people who believe the Uighurs are oppressed by China’s government. Beijing says some Uighurs are Islamist terrorists, and among them is a group that has been smuggled out of China to join Islamic State fighters in Syria.
Prayuth said officials knew from their investigation that people involved in the bombing were about to flee the country and ...

He described him as the main person in the bombing but did not directly say he is suspected of actually planting the bomb. Prayuth said officials knew from their investigation that people involved in the bombing were about to flee the country and had traced the man to Aranyaprathet district in Sa Kaeo, a major crossing point to Cambodia. The prime minister described the man as a piece in a jigsaw puzzle that would connect various parts of the case, which included a bomb that exploded harmlessly in a river next to a busy pier in Bangkok the day after the shrine blast. It was not immediately known if the arrested man is the person who was seen in a security video wearing a yellow T-shirt and leaving a backpack at the shrine shortly before the blast there. Prayuth warned against speculating about the arrested man until more information is learned. He said it would be great if the suspect is the man they are seeking, \"So we will know who they are, where they came from, who\'s behind this.\" \"Don\'t say just yet it\'s about this and that. It could affect international affairs,\" he said. \"We have to do a lot of tests, fingerprints.

3 Chinese nationals have been killed and at least 15 more injured in a bomb that exploded at about 7pm on Monday evening at Bangkok\'s Erawan Shrine.

Separately, Hong Kong authorities have confirmed that at least 3 tourists from the territory have been injured in the explosion. According to local media reports, a number of tourists from Taiwan have also been wounded.

Pictures are circulating on social media of damaged vehicles and body parts strewn all over the explosion site.

Appeals were made for Chinese and Japanese volunteer translators to communicate with victims of the blast, as well as for blood donations at the Police General Hospital and Chulalongkorn Hospital.

The Erawan Shrine, dedicated to Brahma, the four-faced Hindu god of creation, was built in 1956 on the advice of an astrologer to eradicate bad karma believed to have been caused by laying the foundations on the wrong date.

According to one report, the bomb was made of 5kg TNT and hidden under a bench. Another two bombs are said to have been defused. One of them was located at near Gaysorn Plaza at the Ratchaprasong junction, a location that has seen many a political demonstration in recent years.

18 people have been killed in the explosions, according to local media reports. That figure could be as high as 27, according to various unconfirmed reports. Additionally, another 127-160 people are estimated to be injured.
