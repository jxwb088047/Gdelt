If you know a Republican, send this video to them. Restricting homosexuals from true equality, trying to claim ownership of the female body, their protests leading to shutting down our government etc. this nonsense has gone on too long.

ORIGINAL SCRIPT
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT REPUBLICANS

1. You can\'t reason with them.
Republican: You\'re trying to get us all killed.
Emo: No... I just think we should better control who gets guns in this country.
Republican: You\'re socialist democratic scum!
Emo: I\'m actually independent.
Republican: No, you\'re just another mindless drone living off the government.
Emo: Do you realize how insane you sound?
Republican: *lifts gun* You\'ll never take my gun from me.
Emo: No, we\'re only trying to take guns from crazy people...
Republican: *breathing heavily*
Emo: Ok, maybe that applies to you.
Republican: *chambers round*

2. They aggressively oppose matters that are irrelevant to them.
Ryan: So you don\'t like Ryan people?
Republican: No, I just don\'t think you should marry.
Ryan: How is that your business though sweetheart?
Republican: Marriage is my business, it\'s sacred.
Ryan: So church, heaven & God are all pretty sacred to you too?
Republican: Abso-****ing-lutely.
Ryan: Well let me tell you something sugar, the pope says if you\'re a good person, you can go to heaven, I go to church every week & when I get to heaven, I\'ll be sure to sit on God\'s lap and give him a big smooch for you.
Republican: YOU SON OF A *****!!!!
Ryan: Does that bother you?
Republican: You\'re ruining everything I hold dear.
Ryan: Sweetie, I aint messin with your relation...

Donald Trump’s plan to ban muslims from entering the country has crossed a line that most of the Republican establishment won’t. They’re almost universal in criticizing him. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Today, Donald Trump advocated a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The proposal has its roots in the radical fringe of anti-Muslim activists in America. Trump’s campaign made clear it would apply to tourists, refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants — and even Muslim-Americans who are currently abroad.

Several of his competitors for the Republican nomination quickly condemned Trump’s proposal. Even Jeb Bush, who advocated a religious test to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim, blasted the proposal.
But other candidates reactions were much more muted. Rand Paul’s response to Trump’s comments does not condemn Trump’s proposal or even mention it. Instead, he touted his own plan to keep Muslims out of America.”*
