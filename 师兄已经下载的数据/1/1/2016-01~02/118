ABOUT MARCO RUBIO
For Marco Rubio, America is not just the country where he was born -- it is the place that changed his family’s history. His parents came to America from Cuba in 1956 to pursue a better life. His father became a bartender, and his mother became a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. Growing up in Las Vegas and Miami, Marco watched how his parents worked hard and sacrificed to give their children a life better than their own. They never made it big, but they were successful. They achieved the American Dream. And that is why he is running for president. For too many people, the American Dream feels impossible. Opportunity and success seems far away. But Marco has worked tirelessly to restore the hope and promise that the American Dream is real and that every American can achieve their own unique version of that dream. As U.S. Senator, Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative, conservative ideas to address the fundamental issues our country is facing and to restore hope in the American Dream. His ideas are firmly rooted in this simple truth – the American economy has changed significantly in recent de...

Marco Rubio announced in a concession speech tonight that he’s dropping out of the presidential race after losing to Donald Trump in Florida. Rubio spoke of underestimating the anger and frustration of the American people this election cycle and reflected on his life and career in the lead-up to his announcement. He said this year brought a “political storm… we should have seen this coming.” He railed against the political establishment and members of the conservative movement who are in it more for the outrage than principles. He called for a “strong Republican party” and a vibrant conservative movement built on ideas, “not on preying on people’s frustrations.”
 Rubio came out and said this is just not his year, but expressed hope in the future of America and the conservative movement, confident that he ran his campaign the right way.

We will add video when it becomes available.

We were told that Marco Rubio is going to be the savior of the Republican party. Time Magazine ran a cover saying so. They were wrong. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, and Maz Jobrani, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said on Thursday he would not be anybody\'s running-mate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, slamming down rumors that he was seeking the vice presidential nod from former rivals.

\"No, I\'m not going to be anybody\'s vice president... I\'m not interested in being vice president,\" Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill.

Rubio also ruled out both seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate and a run for the Florida governorship, which was speculated as a potential next step for the first-term U.S. senator from Florida.”\"*

Alas, another tribute has fallen. Republican hopeful Marco Rubio decided to suspend his campaign earlier this week after being brutally beaten in the polls by Donald Trump in his home state of Florida. The Late Show host Stephen Colbert gave the senator a perfect send off during a segment for his ongoing \"Hungry for Power Games\" series. Dressed like Caesar Flickerman (played by Stanley Tucci in the films) the comedian highlighted Rubio’s best moments while throwing some nuclear-level shade.
