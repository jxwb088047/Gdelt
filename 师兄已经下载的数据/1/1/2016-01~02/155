Goldwind tops 2015 BNEF ranking of global wind turbine suppliers - SeeNews Renewables
Business news and intelligence for the renewable industry. The newswire goes beyond the familiar renewable markets of Western Europe and the US to encompass the potential of BRIC countries and emerging alternative energy stars in North Africa, Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe.
February 23 (SeeNews) - Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology (HKG:2208) leads Bloomberg New Energy Finance's (BNEF) annual rankings of onshore wind turbine makers with 7.8 GW of capacity commissioned in 2015.
This is the first time a Chinese company has ranked number one in the chart.
Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S (CPH:VWS) came in second with 7.3 GW commissioned, an increase of 2.5 GW compared with 2014.
Vestas turbines were installed across a wide range of markets globally. By contrast, virtually all Goldwind's capacity for 2015 was in China.  
In spite of installing 700 MW more than in 2014, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) fell from first to third place with 5.9 GW. GE is a leader in the US market.
Germany's Siemens (FRA:SIE) tied with Spain's Gamesa (MCE:GAM) for the fourth place, both commissioning 3.1 GW. German rival Enercon dropped to sixth place, while it continued to dominate the German market.
Guodian, Ming Yang, Envision and CSIC, all from China, make up the remainder of the top 10.  
"It’s hardly surprising that five Chinese manufacturers made the top ten ranking in a year where China contributed roughly half of the global capacity," said Amy Grace, head of wind research for BNEF. Last year a record 28.7 GW was installed in the Chinese market, where foreign manufacturers had a combined market share of less than 5%, according to BNEF.
Siemens, meanwhile, led the ranking of offshore turbine manufacturers last year by a wide margin. It commissioned 2.6 GW, which was more than four times the capacity of the number two manufacturer Adwen, a joint venture between Gamesa and Areva.
