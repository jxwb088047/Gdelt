When the United States proudly elected and reelected Barack Obama, we took a positive giant-step in our evolution as a nation. Bolstered by the promise inherent in our progress, I believed, along with many others, in our ability to continue moving forward. But, apparently, we are instead degenerating. We are dragging our knuckles and stooping to the shameful level of...
This headline splashed across the front pages of New York tabloids like a bomb shell. New York reporters knew then that the Donald was the real thing. "The Donald" story, already fodder for the dailies, had legs and would continue on for years and years. And so it has. Marla Maples, Trump's second wife, said, "I had Mister Charm all over me, and it was very hard to say no. When...
Donald Trump is a walking political science course. His meteoric rise is lesson No. 1 on leadership: Most voters do not listen through their ears. They listen through their stomachs.

Author and founder of New...
The Clinton campaign’s coffers are stuffed with money, and the Clintons have nearly every Democratic Party Senator and Governor, along with the Democratic National Committee, in their pocket.

Donald J. Trump is the very defini...
Donald John Trump, Sr. (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, television personality and author. He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts. Trump's extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No. 17 on the 2011 Forbes Celebrity 100 list. He is well-known as a real-estate developer who amassed vast hotel, casino, and other real-estate properties, in the New York City area and around the world.
Trump is the son of Fred Trump, a wealthy New York City real-estate developer. He worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1968 officially joined the company. He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization.
In 2010, Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In May 2011, he announced he would not be a candidate, but a few weeks later he said he had not completely ruled out the possibility. In December 2011, Trump was suggested as a possible Vice Presidential selection by Michele Bachmann. Bachmann has since suspended her presidential campaign.
