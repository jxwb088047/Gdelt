Obama's gun restrictions would punish the innocent - Worldnews.com

 Given a choice between doing something and doing nothing, something usually wins, even when something is the wrong thing to do. In addition to moving himself to tears in recalling tragic shootings during his presidency, Barack Obama has taken wrong steps to prevent new ones with his executive order changing ... ...

President Obama is set to enact a number of new gun control regulations by executive order in the near future. He held a press conference to announce some of the new laws. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to consider what he can do without congressional legislation to reduce gun violence in America, which kills many more people in the US than other developed nations. In a press conference after the meeting, White House officials announced a plan they had been working on for months behind the scenes to address gun violence.

The changes attempt to tighten — but don\'t close — what\'s widely (but misleadingly) known as the \"gun show loophole,\" as well as increase the efficiency of the federal background check system to avoid cases from falling through. The executive actions will also take smaller steps, ranging from improving the tracking of lost or stolen guns to encouraging technological improvements that will, in theory, make firearms safer.”*

If there has ever been a speech that everyone needs to see regarding Obama\'s plan to take our guns. This is the one! In this clip we see an army vet that serves as a police officer speak to the motion to repeal the \'Safe\' act at the Dutchess County Legislature New York State. His name is Aaron Weiss and he has quite a bit say. At some points he even tears up. It isn\'t until he speaks on his friend\'s passing away in war that his emotions get the best of him. We love what this young man has to say to the administration and their plans for disarming our citizens!...

Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman recently said that he will not enforce any new gun laws that he believes are unconstitutional. Sheriff Peyman told Fox News on Monday that the U.S. Constitution is \"like the Bible\" because \"you either believe it or you don\'t.\"
Sheriff Peyman said: \"I swore an oath to the Constitution. And in the Constitution is the Second Amendment and that\'s what this country is based upon. How can I rightfully in my own mind and in my heart come in and take guns away from people when that is their protection?\" 
\"If you take out part, it\'s kind of like the Bible, either you believe it or you don\'t believe it. The Constitution, either you believe it or you don\'t. Either you live by it or you don\'t.\"

When asked how he would protect Americans from gun violence, Sheriff Peyman said: \"The Second Amendment, the way it was designed was to protect the people. In protection, it\'s just like if I\'m a bad guy and I\'m going to go kick a door but I know that the guy behind that door has a gun, and I go to this other door where I know a guy doesn\'t have a gun, that\'s the door I\'m going to kick.\"

\"You\'re still going to have incidences, you\'re still going to have violence. You\'re not going to be able to curb that, but the innocent people are going to be able to protect themselves.\"...

President Obama tells the press after the latest mass shooting that \"thoughts and prayers are not enough.\" He says \"We\'ve become numb\" to the mass shootings. He says the arguments that more guns will make the US more safe are false. \"Does anyone believe that?\" 

\"This is something we should politicize,\" said Obama. \"This is a political choice we make.\" Changing gun laws would save lives.

What is the Gun Control about? 

This video will give you an idea of why the \"powers that be\" are constantly staging shootings in America to pass more stricter gun laws. (This is just the beginning).

The owners of America (Illuminati) don\'t really care THAT much that so many Americans are armed because they know that most people will surrender to their new world order dictatorship without a fight. 

But it will make their process towards full control and enslavement easier if less people have assault rifles. When they send their agents to search american homes (like in the movie Equilibrium), they would obviously rather not meet armed opposition and have a shoot-out. Many Americans will rather die fighting than surrender without a fight only to be sent off to the FEMA concentration camps.

I suggest everyone watches \"Illuminazi\" by Anthony J. Hilder. Will give you more knowledge about this specific matter....

Barack Hussein Obama II (i/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to hold the office. In January 2005, Obama was sworn in as a U.S. Senator in the state of Illinois. He would hold this office until November 2008, when he resigned following his victory in the 2008 presidential election.
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004.
Following an unsuccessful bid against the Democratic incumbent for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2000, Obama ran for the United States Senate in 2004. Several events brought him to national attention during the campaign, including his victory in the March 2004 Illinois Democratic primary for the Senate election and his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He won election to the U.S. Senate in Illinois in November 2004. His presidential campaign began in February 2007, and after a close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination. In the 2008 presidential election, he defeated Republican nominee John McCain, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. In April 2011, he announced that he would be running for re-election in 2012.
