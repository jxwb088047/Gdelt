"MSNBC host Krystal Ball joined host Abby Huntsman on HuffPost Live Thursday to discuss the reasons why her 2010 congressional campaign failed.

After winning the Democratic nomination, sexually suggestive photographs of Ball horsing around with friends at a Christmas party were released. The photos featured Ball using a friends Reindeer nose as a penis in several sexual poses, and Republican Rob Wittman would go on to win the seat from Virginia's conservative first district.

"It was devastating," Ball said, saying it played into her insecurities about not being taken seriously as a female candidate."*

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian discuss Krystal Ball's scandalous photos that came out in her 2010 congressional bid. Are they salacious? Would a photo scandal matter if she were a man?

'You're A Dumbass Aren't You?' MSNBC's Krystal Ball Fooled By Howard Stern Fan
Shep Smith incredulous as State Department opens briefing ... by ignoring Ukraine plane crash
MSNBC's Krystal Ball heavily criticizes Hillary Clinton's book tour, calling the former Secretary of State "tone deaf and unrelatable" and lacking core beliefs.

Even after all these years, some people still fall for Howard Stern's tricks. Reacting to the plane crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, MSNBC's The Cycle supposedly brought on U.S. Staff Sergeant Michael Boyd. He claimed to have seen the missile in the air hit the plane. Suffice it to say, Krystal Ball's interview did not go as planned.

Ball led off by asking "Boyd" what he saw on the ground in Ukraine. "Boyd" responded: " Well, I was looking out the window and I saw a projectile flying through the sky and it would appear that the plane was shot down by a blast of wind from Howard Stern's ass." Not seeming to hear the comment, Ball continued the interview. "So it would appear that the plane was shot down. Can you tell us anything more from your military training of what sort of missile system that may have been coming from?" The man replied with an attack on Ball: "Well, you're a dumbass, aren't you?"

Ball, apparently realizing what had happened, ended the interview: "I'm sorry, sir. Alright, we're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back with all the latest, next."

"Now here's something to drag MSNBC out of its gaffe-cum-apology torpor: Krystal Ball, one of the hosts on MSNBC's afternoon roundtable show "The Cycle," has issued a strong plea to Hillary Rodham Clinton: Stay out of the 2016 race, you corporate tool!

Mind you, those words are the abridgment of the Erik Wemple Blog. Here are Ball's: "Is someone who sat on the rabidly anti-union board of Walmart for six years the right person to restore workers' rights?" Ball asked. "Is someone who recently took $400,000 to give two speeches at Goldman Sachs the person we need to wrest control of the asylum back from the banking inmates?" And: "In a time when we badly need to be inspired and rallied and made to believe that America can once again be true to the American dream, we need someone who is mission-driven, who is clearly passionate, living and breathing and feeling in their bones the plight of the worker, of the middle class. That person is not Hillary Clinton.""* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.
