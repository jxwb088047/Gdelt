Uyghur Woman, 106, Realizes Dream of Visiting Capital - All China Women's Federation
A 106-year-old Uyghur woman, Gulaiwaier Maimaitimin, from northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region paid a visit to Beijing recently, realizing her decades-long travel dream.
To make the visit even more special, the woman arrived at the invitation of Beijing Television to attend the recording of the Spring Festival gala, and tour the metropolis along with other seniors and their children.
Maimaitimin climbed the Tian'anmen Rostrum on January 19, with her family and a retired female soldier named Keyamu Maisaitidi, who is also a member of the Uyghur minority.
They also visited the Memorial Hall of Chairman Mao, Beijing Aquarium, and Beijing Zoo, among other places.
During her visit, the centenarian constantly praised the delights of the city's scenery. Nowadays, since she is accustomed to leading a happy and well-off life, she said her biggest wish was to visit her country's capital.
