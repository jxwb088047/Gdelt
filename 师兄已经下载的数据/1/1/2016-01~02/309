Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Wes Clark Jr., hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"The House on Friday rejected a resolution to approve the Iran nuclear deal, with the vote underscoring how controversial the accord has been with President Obama’s own party.

While most Democrats voted to approve the nuclear bargain, 25 voted against it, creating a wedge that Republicans hope to use to their advantage in the 2016 elections.

Every Republican voted against the resolution, with the exception of libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who voted \"present.\" The tally was 162-269.”*

Speaking with NPR\'s Steve Inskeep, President Obama argued that the Iran nuclear deal \"cuts off all pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon\" and offers \"an entire infrastructure that\'s built to keep track of what Iran\'s doing.\" About the likelihood that a Republican-controlled Congress will reject the deal, the president said that such a move reflects the opposition of \"a near unanimous portion of Republican representatives\" to \"anything I do.” But he offered that once the agreement is implemented, that opposition will “probably be forgotten.”

President Obama announces a framework nuclear deal with Iran, which implemented he said would be \"historic.\"

“It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives” Obama said noting it shuts down Iran\'s path to a nuclear bomb.

After 42 hours overtime, the Iran nuclear negotiations with the United States, Russia, China, France, Great Britain and Germany reached a framework deal in Lausanne, Switzerland. In return for lifting the sanctions, which means more than $110 billion a year relief for Tehran and a return to the global economic market, Iran will be significantly constrained in its nuclear programme. This is the framework agreement, meaning the formal deal will be signed before July 1st. Over the next three months, the technical details will have to be worked out, but what does the Iranian nuclear deal really mean?
