The political rise of real estate mogul Donald Trump has been met with fierce opposition from the Republican establishment. Radio Sputnik’s Loud & Clear examines the likelihood of a brokered convention and the possibility of Trump running as an independent if he fails to win the primary race. ......
When we first heard talk of a "brokered" or "contested" convention during the 2016 invisible primary, it was just a quadrennial amusement, mostly associated with the sheer size of the early GOP presidential field. Wouldn't it be cool, pundits thought, if none of these jokers can get a majority and ... More » ......
Has the power of big money in politics suddenly shrunk? There are many reasons to think so.

If the Republican primary goes all the way to a contested convention, technically anyone could come out of it as the nominee on the Republican side. John Boehner mentioned someone like Paul Ryan. Did he mean someone else? Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Wading into the GOP nominating battle for the first time since leaving office last fall, Boehner said that \"anybody can be nominated\" at the convention in Cleveland this summer.

Boehner, who now splits his time between Florida, Ohio and D.C., had long whispered to friends that he believes Ryan could be the party\'s political savior if it came to that.

But Boehner never said it publicly until now.

In the same question-and-answer session here, Boehner referred to Ted Cruz as \"lucifer.\" He previously called the Texas senator, who led the failed Republican effort to shut down the government over Obamacare, a “jackass.”

Ryan and his staff say he doesn\'t want the nomination.”*

The 11th Republican presidential debate of the 2016 race will feature candidates Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich squaring off in Detroit tonight. The debate is being run by Fox News. NJ Advance Media will be bringing you live updates, beginning just before 9 p.m. 

What to watch for? Here\'s a take from the Associated Press:

Ben Carson\'s departure from the GOP presidential race means the quartet of remaining Republicans on the debate stage Thursday night get more time for attacks as Donald Trump treads a path to the GOP nomination and his three rivals try to trip him up. Cheered on by many Republican leaders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich are racing the primary clock to March 15, likely their last chance to stop Trump in a series of winner-take-all contests.

At campaign events in the past week, Rubio made sometimes crude jokes about everything from Trump\'s tan to the size of his hands — he even suggested that the billionaire wet his pants at the last debate. Look for whether a newly confident Rubio, emboldened by his first primary win in Minnesota Tuesday, keeps it up or takes a more statesmanlike approach.

And what to expect from Trump? \"I can\'t act overly presidential because I\'m going to have people attacking from every side. A very good man, Ben Carson\'s not there anymore, so now we\'re going to have more time for the fighting,\" he said. \"When people are hitting you from different angles, from all different angles, unfortunately you have to hit back. I would have a very, very presidential demeanor when I win, but until such time, you have t...

GOOD MORNING AMERICA\'S HOMEPAGE:

The Republican is a newspaper based in Springfield, Massachusetts. It is owned by Newhouse Newspapers, a division of Advance Publications. It played important roles in the United States Republican Party's founding, Charles Dow's career, and the invention of the pronoun "Ms."
Established by Samuel Bowles II in 1824 as a rural weekly, it was converted into a daily in 1844. From the beginning it had a focus on local news. As rapidly as possible its news-gathering was extended until within a few years its columns contained departments of items from every town and hamlet along the Connecticut Valley, as well as from Springfield. It achieved national renown in the nineteenth century under the tenure of Samuel Bowles III, a legacy that was passed to his son, Samuel Bowles IV.
In 1855, Bowles II called for the founding of a new party that would abolish slavery. He suggested the name "Republican." Once abolitionists founded a party by this name, The Republican became one if its most unrelenting supporters.
