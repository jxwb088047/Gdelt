During a recent interview, Donald Trump was asked if he would use nuclear weapons against ISIS. Trump said he wasn’t going to answer because he likes to keep his military strategy cards close to the vest. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"WRKO’s Jeff Kuhner asked Trump about the news that Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to nuke ISIS. “Would Donald Trump be open, like Putin, to using nuclear weapons to defeat Islamofascism and to wipe out ISIS?” he asked.

But Trump demurred on the question. “Now, understand what I’m saying; I don’t wanna give you an answer to that.”

Trump said he didn’t want America’s enemies to know his game plan. “Because part of the problem that we have with Obama is they’re so predictable, they give answers to everything. They sent troops over there and they announce they’re sending fifty people over there and now those troops have a target of their head.”

“So I don’t want to answer the question,” he said. “I will tell you this; we will be defeating ISIS big league.””*

At Thursday nights debate, Donaldn Trump claimed he would deploy up to 30,000 American soldiers in the Middle East to defeat the Islamic State. Trump said, “We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS,” Trump typically speaks against American military involvement around the world, but he was not alone in calling for ground troops in Iraq and Syria during the debate. Central Command has previously said that more troops on the ground are required to defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

House votes 407-19 to reform the Visa Waiver Program if traveller has been to the Muslim Islamic countries of Iraq or Syria within the past five years. 

The Visa Waiver Program includes 38 countries, including the United States, France, and Belgium, where there have been Islamic terror attacks within the past few weeks. The bill proposed will deny visa free travel to the United States if the traveller has been to Iraq or Syria (and possible other terror hot-spots) within the past five years. Traveller would required to obtain a visa from their respective consulate or embassy, with the exception of official government business and military service.

It\'s ironic that just one day after Donald Trump posts a press release to his website calling for a temporary moratorium on Muslim Immigration, that the house passes a bill 407-19 which restricts visa-free travel to those who have been in Iraq or Syria within the past five years. Were the people who voted on this bill today - Tuesday, December 8th, 2015, influenced by the media fallout and/or the content of his press release? Seems like they were. They had to have been. How could they not?

I nearly missed the news about the house bill. It was only a small blurb on Facebook about it from an AP article that Fox News reposted and aired a short news segment about which is featured on their website. I\'ll post a link to the story will be in the links below. The news clip featured former DNC official David Mercer and Former Deputy Assistant to George W. Bush, Bradley Blakeman.

A Black Lives Matter protester went to a Donald Trump rally. He was beaten and choked by several angry Trump supporters. This is becoming a very disturbing trend among the Trump faithful. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"After his supporters beat up a Black Lives Matter protester on video, Donald Trump suggested that they may have done the right thing.
The protester, a black man, reportedly started chanting Black Lives Matter at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama on Saturday. In a video captured by CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond, rally attendees swarm around the man, kicking and punching him as he curls up on the ground.

Trump was asked to weigh in on his supporters’ actions on Fox & Friends Sunday morning. “Maybe he should have been roughed up,” he said. “It was disgusting what he was doing.””*

The Pentagon Inspector General is looking into intelligence that suggests a cover-up. Senior officials allegedly altered pentagon analyst reports that painted a very bleak picture of our efforts in the middle-east. Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Allegations are mounting that senior intelligence officials at Central Command not only skewed findings on the ISIS war to please D.C., but tried to hide what they did…

In July, a group of intelligence analysts at the U.S. military’s Central Command accused their bosses of distorting and selectively editing intelligence reports about the fight against ISIS in order to portray that campaign as more successful than it really was. As a result of those complaints, the Pentagon’s inspector general opened an investigation.

Now, the allegations of misconduct have extended to a possible cover-up, with some analysts accusing the senior intelligence officials at Centcom, Maj. Gen. Steven Grove and his civilian deputy, Gregory Ryckman, of deleting emails and files from computer systems before the inspector general could examine them, three individuals familiar with the investigation told The Daily Beast.”*

The Syrian uprising is an ongoing, violent internal conflict in Syria. It is part of the wider Arab Spring, a wave of upheaval throughout the Arab world. Public demonstrations across Syria began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba’ath Party rule.
Since spring 2011, the Syrian government has deployed the Syrian Army to quell the uprising. Several cities have been besieged, but nevertheless the unrest continues. According to witnesses, soldiers who refused to open fire on civilians were summarily executed by the Syrian Army. The Syrian government denied reports of defections, and blamed "armed gangs" for causing trouble. Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an insurgency campaign against the Syrian Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the Free Syrian Army and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacks an organized leadership.
