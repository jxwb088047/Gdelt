Islamic State has built its own secure Android messaging app, according to a counter-terrorism network affiliated with the hacktivist group Anonymous. The app is reportedly being used to send encrypted messages regarding planned attacks.

The app, called Alrawi.apk, is being used by the terror group for communications and contains “encrypted communications features,” according to Ghost Security Group (GhostSec).

Both Alrawi.apk and the Amaq Agency app use the Android operating system, but are not available through the Google Play store. Instead, IS supporters must download the app\'s code in order to run it on their smartphones or tablets.

Prior to the newest two apps, IS was using the encrypted messaging app Telegram to distribute propaganda and recruit potential militants. Telegram says it has suspended over 660 IS-related accounts since November.

It’s often frustrating that our intelligence agencies can’t seem to track down most of ISIS considering how active they are online. Anonymous has decided to join the fight. They want to dox ISIS and send their addresses to Seal Team 6 for the most uber pownage of all time. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"After the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for Friday’s wave of attacks that killed more than 130 people in Paris, the hactivist collective Anonymous declared war on the terrorist faction and its supporters.

\"Make no mistake: Anonymous is at war with Daesh,\" the enigmatic hacker group wrote on Twitter over the weekend, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Make no mistake: #Anonymous is at war with #Daesh. We won\'t stop opposing #IslamicState. We\'re also better hackers. #OpISIS

The group uploaded videos in multiple languages, including English and Italian, in which it vowed to \"neutralize\" the perpetrators of Friday\'s attacks.

\"We will not give up, we do not forgive,\" said a person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. \"Expect us.””*

WASHINGTON — Following the devastating attacks in Paris on November 13th, terrorists have released a new propaganda threatening future attacks on Washington, D.C.

The authenticity of the video has yet to be verified, but the men issuing the threats claim to be ISIS militants. In response, US authorities are ramping up security measures in several places across the nation\'s capital. 

Counterterrorism police reinforcements are now set up outside the French embassy in DC, and secret service at the White House is on high alert. Given the nature of the Paris attacks, soft-target areas are of particular concern to DC local police. Citizens riding public transit have been told to report any suspicious activity, and popular tourist attractions will be monitored at higher than normal levels.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims it hasn\'t received any indication of an immediate attack, and says ISIS likely lacks the capabilities to execute similar attacks on the US. However, CIA Director John Brennan says he believes ISIS has more attack operations \"in the pipeline,\" and does not consider the nightmare in Paris a \"one-off event.\"

A new app lets you take pictures of any suspicious sightings and activities and send direct to the authorities in the help to fight terrorism

New York State launches anti-terror app to anonymously report suspicious-looking people without fear of appearing racist 

New Yorkers now have a new tool in the fight against terrorism - a smartphone app.
The app, dubbed \'See Something, Send Something\', allows people across the state to send photos and information of suspicious-looking people and activities to officials with the tap of a screen.
They can do so anonymously, without the fear of appearing discriminatory. 
After receiving a terror report via the app, the New York State Intelligence Center will then look at it and evaluate its credibility, before alerting the relevant enforcement agency if it is deemed real.

The app was unveiled last night by Governor Andrew Cuomo in the wake of the Paris massacre, during which 130 people were killed by terrorists in a series of shootings and suicide bombings.
It is now available to download, for free, on iPhones and Androids. 
Once \'See Something, Send Something\' is launched on their phones, users must enter their name and phone number. They can then send information on any suspicious sightings right away.

\'Please send a note with as much detail as possible,\' the app tells users sending messages.
The app - also available in other states like Colorado, Louisiana and Ohio – includes information on what sorts of ...

Three hacker groups have teamed up to release the names of 9,200 Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State.

Anonymous, CtrlSec and GhostSec released the list as part of #OPIsis, a campaign geared at disrupting the terrorist organization\'s online communication. 

The \"hacktivists\" said they hope the list will pressure Twitter to ban the accounts.

\"We\'re releasing it to hold Twitter accountable,\" Anonymous wrote. \"I encourage you all to do your duty not only as a citizen of the world but also as a member of the internet community and re-post this on social media.\"

IS uses Twitter and other social media sites to recruit members and share updates. The group has posted many of its gruesome beheadings on Twitter and Sendvid. 

Twitter has already suspended or removed thousands of accounts linked to IS, but the use of swarm accounts -- or the creation of multiple accounts to share each others\' content -- has helped IS get around those suspensions. 

The recently released list exposed the largest number of IS-linked accounts to date. 

Many of the accounts have since disappeared from Twitter. 

A Foreign Policy article recently suggested the U.S. government should fund Anonymous and other hacktivists with bitcoins, so the groups can intensify their efforts against IS.

UNKNOWN — Mexico’s most-wanted drug lord, Joaquin Guzman a.k.a. El Chapo, has declared war on ISIS in an email to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a prominent leader of the Islamic State, threatening that his cartel will wipe them off the planet. Actually, he hasn’t. The viral story was penned by Steve Charnock from Thug Life.

Charnock uploaded the story to cartelblog.com, writing that a Mexican blogger leaked the message after being sent the encrypted email from El Chapo to the ISIS leader. 

In this hoax story, Charnock wrote that El Chapo was angry because ISIS destroyed one of his drug shipments in the Middle East. 

The story was picked up by a number of media outlets around the world. The story contained fantastic details such as an angry email in which El Chapo wrote: “You are not soldiers. You are nothing but lowly p*ssies. Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.” 

“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a wh*re that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them.”

The first responsibility of every government is to keep our country as safe as possible.

I regret to say that a growing number of Australians are now traveling to Iraq and Syria and other conflict zones.

Their aim is do harm and some hope to bring back deadly skills to Australia.

The threat to Australia and to Australians from these extremists is real and growing.

So this week, the Government announced a series of measures that will strengthen our national security.

The Government will be providing a further $630 million over four years to boost the counter terrorism capacity of our security and intelligence organisations, including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.

We will prosecute those who engage in terrorism tourism. This is a serious offence – and if you do it, it will mean jail.

The Government is strengthening our ability to monitor, arrest, and prosecute people who have been involved with terrorist groups abroad.  As well, we want to prevent would-be terrorists from departing Australia.

As part of these plans, we want telecommunications companies to keep their data. We don’t want to collect new data – but to ensure the limited data already collected can be accessed by authorities to build a case against those who have or are planning to commit crimes.

And we are determined to stop the flow of money that supports these extremists in their activities.

These are measures to make 23 million Australians safer.

We will keep our promise to provide you with a safe and ...

UNKNOWN — \"Hello. ISIS tech support desk. How may we assist you in your evil doings today?\" Well, they might not use that as their opening line, but media sources are reporting that the terror group calling themselves Islamic State is running a 24/7 online jihadi help desk to aid would-be fighters and terrorists by teaching them how to better secure their communications and evade detection by law enforcement. 

Speaking to the Army Times, U.S. Military Academy assistant professor Aaron Brantly said that many terror suspects fall in between \"tech-ignorant\" and \"tech- savvy,\" and ISIS seeks to provide tips on encryption and security so members aren\'t targeted by intercepted communications. 

Following the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, governments around the world have been scrambling to boost cyber security, knowing that terrorists seeking holes in that security just as they did in Paris by reportedly using an app called Telegram to communicate. The app works across most platforms and also allows encrypted messages and even ultra-private messages that reportedly \"self-destruct.\" 

The establishment of a jihadi help desk online is a worrying development that, \"enables [ISIS] to communicate and engage in operations beyond what used to happen, and in a much more expeditious manner. They are operating at the speed of cyberspace rather than the speed of person-to-person mitigations,\" said assistant professor Brantly.

UNKNOWN — \"Hello. ISIS tech support desk. How may we assist you in your evil doings today?\" Well, they might not use that as their opening line, but media sources are reporting that the terror group calling themselves Islamic State is running a 24/7 online jihadi help desk to aid would-be fighters and terrorists by teaching them how to better secure their communications and evade detection by law enforcement. 

Speaking to the Army Times, U.S. Military Academy assistant professor Aaron Brantly said that many terror suspects fall in between \"tech-ignorant\" and \"tech- savvy,\" and ISIS seeks to provide tips on encryption and security so members aren\'t targeted by intercepted communications.

SYRIA — In another diabolical scheme from the Islamic State terror group, unconfirmed photos of chickens strapped with loaded suicide belts have appeared on the Internet.

It seems that desperate jihadists fighting for the ISIS cause have begun to recruit unwilling hens to use as mobile explosive devices. The idea is that once the chickens have successfully infiltrated an enemy camp or at least come within striking distance the ISIS extremists remotely detonate the devices.

Chickens weren’t the first choice for the ISIS extremists. The suicide chicken photos began to appear a few days after a report of a suicide-goat-bomb targeting a Kurdish base. Perhaps the goat was too large to avoid enemy detection, which was why ISIS began using chickens?

It just seems like a desperate, bird-brained idea if you ask us.
