It was the “excuse me” that echoed around Democratic politics. In their intense Flint, Mich., debate, Bernie Sanders pointedly said to Hillary Clinton in the heat of one exchange, “Excuse me, I’m talking.” Sanders has an $18 trillion unicorns-dancing-on-rainbows spending program and a paranoiac’s view of Wall Street, but nothing is quite as disqualifying for the feminist left...
Bernie Sanders is the only Democrat not linked to an FBI investigation. If this doesn't mean anything to you, then you're too terrified of Trump's rallies to realize that Clinton could get indicted. Also, if you can't fathom the possibility of Donald Trump winning, then keep in mind that most Americans don't trust or like Hillary Clinton. A general election isn't a popularity...
Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had to battle with past immigration stances at Wednesday's Democratic debate. Sanders went first. In 2007, Sanders voted against an immigration reform bill.

Flint, Michigan (CNN)It was no Republican debate -- nobody talked about the size of their hands or made up demeaning nicknames -- but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were ready for action Sunday night.

Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola and Jimmy Dore of The Young Turks discuss how Bernie Sanders did in the Democratic primary election on Super Tuesday 3. Do you think Bernie still has a chance? Do you agree with TYT\'s opinion? Tell us what you think in the comment section below....
President Obama and Bernie Sanders disagree on many things. One of them is Obama’s latest supreme court pick Merrick Garland. Bernie explained what he would like to do if elected President. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, and Maz Jobrani (Jimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Vermont Sen. and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said he fully supports President Obama\'s nominee for the Supreme Court, 63-year-old Judge Merrick Garland. But should Sanders become president-elect in November, he would ask Obama to withdraw his nomination, he said Thursday night in an interview with MSNBC\'s Rachel Maddow. The self-described Democratic socialist would want a justice who\'s more progressive than Garland...

\"I have said over and over again that I do have a litmus test for a Supreme Court justice,\" Sanders said to Maddow. \"The justice must be loud and clear in telling us that he or she will vote to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. I am very worried about the future of American democracy and about the ability of billionaires to buy elections. That is my litmus test and that’s what I would insist on.””*

Last night Bernie Sanders had a field day. He mopped the floor with Hillary Clinton. He received a standing ovation. You wouldn’t know it by looking at the headlines of corporate media. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Hillary Clinton may have been facing Bernie Sanders at Wednesday’s debate, but in reality she was shadowboxing Donald Trump.

The Republican frontrunner, who was the only GOP candidate who had supporters rallying in front of the Democratic debate, was the 800-pound gorilla in the room. He was named outright more than a dozen times, and referenced in the answers that didn’t refer to him directly.

In responding to questions about billionaire businessman, Clinton gave hints of what her general election strategy might look like. She mocked Trump’s “beautiful tall wall” and derided his divisiveness. She drew clear differences in their trade and climate strategies. And Clinton portrayed herself as earnest and wonky and positive, running “an inclusive campaign,” versus the real estate mogul she said profits from promoting divisiveness.

The debate, the last one scheduled for now on the Democratic side, comes as Clinton and Trump seek to cement their leads and secure their parties’ nominations.”*

Bernard "Bernie" Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is the junior United States Senator from Vermont. He previously represented Vermont's at-large district in the United States House of Representatives. Sanders also served as mayor of Burlington, Vermont.
Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has praised European social democracy (though he has also criticized its contemporary "Third Way" departure). He is the first person elected to the U.S. Senate to identify as a socialist. Sanders caucuses with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments, but because he does not belong to a formal political party, he appears as an independent on the ballot. He was also the only independent member of the House during much of his service there.
Sanders, the son of Jewish Polish immigrants to the United States, was born in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn and later attended the University of Chicago, graduating with an B.A. in political science in 1964. After graduating from college, Sanders spent time on an Israeli kibbutz, an experience which shaped his political views. In 1964, Sanders moved to Vermont, where he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, writer and researcher, among other jobs.
