Mizzou Professor Now Charged With Assault - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 27, 20161 Comment
The Mizzou Communications Professor who tried to stop reporters from covering student protests has been charged with third degree assault. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“…[Melissa] Click’s actions sparked a national outcry, raising concerns about press freedom on the campus. The University of Missouri School of Journalism met to discuss revoking Click’s “courtesy appointment” at the school, but Click resigned before the panel reached a decision. She later issued an apology.
“I regret the language and strategies I used, and sincerely apologize to the MU campus community, and journalists at large, for my behavior, and also for the way my actions have shifted attention away from the students’ campaign for justice,” Click said in a Nov. 10 statement.
Mark Schierbecker, the student journalist behind the viral video, filed a complaint in November over the incident. In an email to HuffPost, he praised the city prosecutor’s decision to bring charges.”*
I would think it’s significant assault because she calls for muscle, a clear physical threat intending to intimidate the photographers right to record on public property. I probably wouldn’t have done it, but it should have consequences.
