Official: Former Secretary's Of State Rice, Powell Sent Classified Emails From Personal Account - Worldnews.com

The U.S. State Department confirmed Thursday not only did current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have confidential and secret information in her personal email, but so did the people she succeeded, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, a CBS News report said.

A source familiar with the preliminary investigation by the State Department’s inspector general said about a dozen emails were sent or received during six years of George W. Bush’s administration. The report, which is still under review, said the emails were considered confidential or secret. It stress none of the emails were classified as top secret.

On Thursday, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, said the State Department inspector general disclosed the new information Wednesday night in a memo to a top State Department official.

"The Inspector General raised concerns that additional potentially classified may continue to reside in the Department's unclassified archives associated with Secretaries Powell and Rice and their respective staffs and recommended that the Department review those archives and remove all classified information," Cummings' office told CBS News.

Cummings sent a letter to the State Department seeking copies of the emails as well as exchanges between the department, inspector general and others.

"My concern has been that Republicans are spending millions of taxpayer dollars singling out Secretary Clinton because she is running for President – often leaking inaccurate information – while at the same time disregarding the actions of Republican Secretaries of State," he said.
Condoleezza Rice ( /ˌkɒndəˈliːzə/; born November 14, 1954) is an American political scientist and diplomat. She served as the 66th United States Secretary of State, and was the second person to hold that office in the administration of President George W. Bush. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state, as well as the second African American (after Colin Powell), and the second woman (after Madeleine Albright). Rice was President Bush's National Security Advisor during his first term, making her the first woman to serve in that position. Before joining the Bush administration, she was a professor of political science at Stanford University where she served as Provost from 1993 to 1999. Rice also served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and East European Affairs Advisor to President George H.W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification.
Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy, with a focus on democracy in the Greater Middle East. Her emphasis on supporting democratically elected governments faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems with U.S. support. While Secretary of State, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.

Hillary Clinton is not alone. An investigation by the State Department\'s Inspector General has found classified information sent to the personal email accounts of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the senior staff of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Inspector General Steve Linick said that the State Department has determined that 12 emails examined from State\'s archives contained national security information now classified \"Secret\" or \"Confidential.\" Two of the messages were sent to Powell\'s personal account, and 10 were sent to personal accounts of Rice\'s senior aides. Linick said his initial findings suggest there could be a lot more classified material in State\'s unclassified archives than previously thought.

ormer U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and aides to his successor, Condoleezza Rice, both received classified information a handful of times via personal email accounts, the top Democrat on a congressional oversight panel said on Thursday.

The findings come after nearly a year of controversy over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\'s decision to set up a private email server for her work as secretary of state. Democratic lawmakers and staff on Clinton\'s presidential campaign seized on the report as vindicating some of their defenses of the controversial arrangement.

Representative Elijah Cummings said the disclosures about Powell\'s and Rice\'s aides\' emails were made by the State Department\'s inspector general, who is reviewing the email practices of the last five secretaries of state.

That office told the State Department on Wednesday that it found 12 emails containing classified information sent to Rice\'s aides or Powell, according to Cummings, who is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee.

In a statement, Powell said the two emails he received were not judged to contain confidential information at the time they were sent to him by American ambassadors.

\"I wish they would release them,\" Powell told NBC News, \"so that a normal, air-breathing mammal would look at them and say, \'What\'s the issue?\'\"

A representative for Rice, who, as with Powell, served under Republican President George W. Bush, said the 10 emails sent to her aides did not contain intelligence information.

At a Democratic debate last night, Jorge Ramos pressed Hillary Clinton on the investigation into her private email server. 

\"If you get indicted, would you drop out?\" he asked.

\"Oh for goodness sake. It\'s not going to happen. I\'m not even answering that question,\" said Clinton to huge applause. 

Ramos also asked who gave her permission to use a private server while she was secretary of state. 

\"Was it President Obama?\" he asked.

Clinton argued that the same thing was done by her predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and so it was already permitted.

Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighed in on this exchange on America\'s Newsroom, saying that Clinton made an \"apples and oranges\" comparison with previous secretaries of state.

He said Powell and Rice did not have servers in their homes, as Clinton did. 

\"The secretary of state has two email streams: a regular email stream and a secret email stream. Mrs. Clinton hired, at her own expense, an information technologist, to divert both email streams to the home server. Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice did nothing of the sort,\" said Napolitano, lauding Ramos for demonstrating an \"excellent understanding\" of the issues in the case. 

The judge said that Clinton keeps repeating a misleading statement that she never sent or received any emails that were \"marked classified.\"

\"We know and the FBI knows and she knows that nothing is marked classified. And yet she continues to mislead the questioner, thereby sending, if you will, a dog whistle to the FBI: her natural inclination is not to tel...

The state department watchdog found that both Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, America’s top diplomats under president George W Bush, were sent sensitive national security information to non-government email addresses. Thursday\'s claims called vindication for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. A spokesman for Clinton was quick to seize on the findings, arguing that they demonstrate “just how routine it is for government bureaucrats to go overboard” in keeping information secret from the public. Senior Democrat Harry Reid called it “a watershed moment”.

Lanny Davis, former special counsel to President Bill Clinton, had a testy argument with America’s Newsroom host Bill Hemmer over Hillary Clinton’s continuing email scandal. Emails from Davis are among those which have been released by the State Department, including one the Weekly Standard called the “DC’s most cringe-inducing document ever.” “Four of these 22 emails are labeled ‘SAP’, which essentially means they’re too secret for even the FBI agents to see it. They are too secret for members of Congress to even view it. This is drone information. It’s information about moles working in other countries. This is the top of the heap when it comes to our national secrets. Now, Lanny, do you believe negligence is part of the law?” Hemmer said. “First of all, negligence is not part of the law. And secondly, she wasn’t negligent any more than Colin Powell or Condi Rice was in forwarding emails,” Davis said.

“And I don’t know what you mean by ‘SAP’ but it’s not a classified document if it says ‘SAP’. If you’re questioning judgement of Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton forwarding what they didn’t regard as classified and there’s no label on it, you’re allowed to disagree with that, but don’t say it might lead to criminal behavior because it didn’t for them.” - “Reading from Judge (Andrew) Napolitano’s piece from March 3, OK, SAP is a subcategory of Top Secret and it constitutes the highest level of protected secrecy for the upmost protection of the government’s gravest secrets,” Hemmer said. “That’s SAP.” - “OK, well, if that’s SAP, it’s not classified.

Judge Andrew Napolitano challenged Hillary Clinton’s contention that former secretaries of state also used private email servers to conduct government business. “My predecessors did the same thing,” Clinton said during Wednesday’s Democratic debate. “Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice did nothing of the sort,” Napolitano told “America’s Newsroom” host Bill Hemmer on Thursday when asked to explain the legal distinction between the use of private emails and a private server. “Her predecessors, and let’s identify them – Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice – did not have servers in their own home,\" Napolitano said. \"The secretary of state has two email streams: a regular email stream and a secret email stream.

On Fox News Thursday, Judge Andrew Napolitano discussed Hillary Clinton’s answer to being asked about her email server and possible indictment during the Univision Democratic presidential debate the prior night. He said that her answers to these questions showed her natural inclination to not tell the truth, as well as her ignorance of the law. Clinton was asked by moderator Jorge Ramos, “The question was, ‘who gave you permission? Was is President Barack Obama?’” To which she responded, “there was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted. I didn’t have to ask anyone.” - “If you are indicted would you drop out?” Ramos asked back. “For goodness– it’s not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question.”

Napolitano’s reaction to this was to point out that there is a difference between the emails and the private server itself.

Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice did nothing of the sort.” He finished, “You’re really comparing apples and oranges here.” Host Bill Hemmer questioned Judge Napolitano about if the public is asking the wrong question to Clinton. Should they be asking about the emails she sent or the server that was installed in her home?

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said this week that the FBI has contacted him about his personal email use when he was the nation\'s top diplomat. The contact was part of a review conducted by the State Department inspector general who concluded that Powell and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice both received classified information through personal email accounts. The revelation that the State Department believes both Rice and Powell received sensitive information from a personal account could give former secretary Hillary Clinton a new line of defense while she tries to calm the controversy over classified information found on her own private email server.

Condoleezza Rice ( /ˌkɒndəˈliːzə/; born November 14, 1954) is an American political scientist and diplomat. She served as the 66th United States Secretary of State, and was the second person to hold that office in the administration of President George W. Bush. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state, as well as the second African American (after Colin Powell), and the second woman (after Madeleine Albright). Rice was President Bush's National Security Advisor during his first term, making her the first woman to serve in that position. Before joining the Bush administration, she was a professor of political science at Stanford University where she served as Provost from 1993 to 1999. Rice also served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and East European Affairs Advisor to President George H.W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification.
Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy, with a focus on democracy in the Greater Middle East. Her emphasis on supporting democratically elected governments faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems with U.S. support. While Secretary of State, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.
