Book of the Week: Road to perception | Books | financialmail
FORTY kilometres from Kabul lies the extensive archaeological site of Mes Aynak, which epitomises the profound civilisational inheritance of the silk roads. Today we see Afghanistan as a country in ruins, but as far back as 5,000 years ago Mes Aynak was a richly productive copper mine located upon the axis of trade and cultural collision between ancient Persia, Greece, and central Asia.
The Silk Roads is not revisionist, but it is certainly provocative. The book’s sub title is an unsubtle jibe at the establishment’s Western-centric moulding of history, in particular the attitude and skew of JM Roberts’s Penguin History of the World, revised as recently as 2007.
Frankopan, a senior research fellow at Oxford specialising in Byzantine studies, concentrates the narrative within the region spanning the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf to western China, and from the Eurasian steppes to the Himalayas of north India. His core premise is that this was the epicentre of history, its geographic position making the zone a natural crossroads. Even in antiquity, “this was a world that was connected, complex and hungry for exchange”. Here was the crucible of the world’s great religions, and the trade routes traversing the territory were the first links between China and the Mediterranean — the formative arteries for intercontinental commerce — conveying cargos such as spices and slaves, silks and silver, porcelain and prized horses.
But if this region was the birthplace of much of the positive of civilisations, it was also the locus of terrible conflicts stretching back millennia. The theme of clashes and conquest resonates: this has always been the very eyewall of empires’ storms, throughout the halcyon centuries of Persian rule, Alexander the Great’s Macedonian realm, the Huns of eastern Europe and the Caucasus, the Mongol khanates expanding from the Central Asian steppes, and the Ottomans.
The book’s most dramatic sweep is in describing the impact and effects of the discovery of Middle East oil at the turn of the 20th century. This disrupted the straightforward convention, namely the rule of might. The modern era colonial sovereigns now had to duel not just with one another, but also with the territories’ shahs and sheiks who understood they could play one imperialist or superpower against the other to leverage economic aid, corrupt pay-offs, and — especially in the Cold War era — an increasing flow of military hardware. The silk roads rapidly mutated to incorporate a criss-cross of pipelines, as the area became the “carotid artery” for global industry. But oil was also the lighter fluid for widespread political turmoil in the ensuing century.
In our age of rapid analyses in byte form, The Silk Roads is history as a slow feast. The author weaves an immense pattern across tumultuous eras and colossal empires, held together with intriguing threads of small stories such as the seventh century belief that Mohammed had simply adapted Islam from Christianity after conversing with an errant monk. His leitmotif is to encapsulate intricate issues into pithy, digestible closing summaries, bridging elegantly into the next chapter. This contributes to the flow and storytelling eloquence, making the 562 pages accessible — though perhaps not an easy read for occasional observers of history.
But if capable historians take us on a contextual journey down the paths of the past, great historians also reveal overarching shifts and seminal events which unlock deeper understanding of the present, and portents of the future. The timing of the book’s release enhances its importance and value. For example, as we see Russia and Turkey facing off in Syria, it’s helpful to realise that the enmity goes back a thousand years when Russia’s Viking forerunners first raided Constantinople, and that both countries’ current presidents — tsar-and sultan-like — seem hell-bent on restoring empires lost in 1918, or at least mollifying resentment that they have never been properly respected nor accepted by the West.
Similarly, Isis asserts as one of its aims the reversal of the de facto outcomes of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, an arbitrary British-French carve-up of Middle Eastern territory after World War 1. A chapter entitled The Road to Compromise presents powerful evidence of the West’s duplicity as, in their strategic but insatiable quest for black gold, they reneged on promises made to Arab leaders, and displayed disdain for their colonial subjects. This spawned a sense of betrayal and when viewed through the prism of a 900-year-old revenge-in-the-making — a reversal of the carnage of the Crusades — Isis’s barbarity at least has a context.
Frankopan’s academic brilliance comes across in the referencing of voluminous sources spanning many languages and including recently declassified gems from the Cold War period. His cerebral boldness works masterfully in all respects bar one: a conclusion that “the Silk Roads are rising again”. This is a leap too far in blanketing a description of corrupt and despotic regimes in nations such as Azerbaijan, and fictional democracies the like of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The flaw in his assertion is seen in the desperation of refugees travelling the silk roads today, an appalling exodus primarily from the war zones of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and comprising the biggest flow of refugees within Europe since World War 2.
Meanwhile, Mes Aynak archaeologists are racing against time as Afghanistan’s government, desperate for funds, has mortgaged the soul of the site’s cultural heritage by selling a 30-year copper mining concession to China for US$3bn. And — having previously been used as an Al-Qaeda training camp, and in close proximity to Uighur separatist activity — the US and China both maintain a vigilant military monitoring of the locale.
So the historical patterns reverberate and, tragically, swathes of the “centre of the world” remain in shadow, bookended by superpowers dancing a different twist in an ongoing Great Game.
Admirably, The Silk Roads casts light, and perspective, on these troubled theatres. We may disagree with his conclusion, but Frankopan would no doubt feel vindicated that the fulcrum of momentous global developments is manifestly still rooted where he believes it has always been.
