Chris Christie has officially endorsed Donald Trump for president. A hot mic recently caught a short exchange between the two at a rally. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Donald Trump told Chris Christie to \"go home\" after the New Jersey governor introduced the billionaire at a campaign rally in Arkansas on Saturday.

“Get on the plane and go home,” Trump is heard saying to Christie.

Christie arrived at the rally with Trump via the real estate mogul’s plane. The two exited the plane in front of a crowd and then Christie introduced Trump.

After the short introduction, the two shook hands while Trump leaned in to say something unintelligible. Then, Trump can be heard telling Christie to get on the plane.

Christie endorsed Trump earlier this week.”*

From \"All In with Chris Hayes\" (March 14, 2016):

Chris Hayes: Just a short time ago, Trump wrapped up a rally in Youngstown, Ohio— another GOP winner-take-all state voting tomorrow—where he mocked John Kasich for being an absentee governor of that state before taking a shot at the man who introduced him it at the rally: Chris Christie, who was sitting right there.

Donald Trump: Your governor is absentee. He goes—listen to this, \'cause I know, \'cause I was there, but I go back and I still work, you know, I have a job, right? You\'ve gotta do your job. So your governor, Kasich, if you look at him—and, and I\'m being totally impartial. He goes to New Hampshire, he\'s living in New Hampshire. Living. Where\'s Chris? Is Chris around? Even more than Chris Christie, he was there. Right? Even more.

I hated to do that, but I had to make my point....
