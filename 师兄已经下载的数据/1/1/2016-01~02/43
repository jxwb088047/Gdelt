CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA — The FBI is asking for Apple\'s help in mining data that\'s locked behind a passcode on a phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik leading up to the San Bernardino shooting on Dec. 2.

The FBI believe key details regarding the San Bernardino shooting may be encrypted on the terrorists iPhone. However, if investigators enter the wrong passcode too many times, the phone will be wiped clean. 

The FBI asked Apple to help them unlock the phone but Apple CEO Tim Cook says this is \"an overreach by the U.S. government.\" 

In a statement released by Apple, Tim Cook said, \"We are challenging the FBI\'s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.\" 

If Apple were to say open a backdoor for the FBI to access data on the shooters phone, it would compromise the security of all iPhone users and potentially give the U.S. government access any iPhone in their possession. 

The feds are citing the All Writs Act of 1789 to make their case while Tim Cook is sticking to his guns about protecting iPhone users\' security.

WASHINGTON — A U.S. magistrate judge has ordered Apple to help the FBI hack into an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December. The ruling by Judge Sheri Pym on Tuesday requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the phone to cripple a security encryption feature that erases data after too many unsuccessful unlocking attempts. Federal prosecutors told the judge they can\'t access a county-owned work phone used by Syed Farook because they don\'t know his passcode.

Apple has been given a court order to hack into the I-Phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. But Apple CEO Tim Cook is fighting the judge\'s ruling to break into the shooters phone. 

FBI agents obtained legal permission to retrieve data from San Bernardino Shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook\'s I-Phone. But thanks to an Apple security feature, the agency hasn\'t been able to access the phone without wiping the data. That\'s because the I -Phone\'s have a security feature that wipes all the data after 10 failed passcode attempts and the FBI could risk loosing all possible critical information. 

In a public letter, Cook wrote that the court order to help the agency is a dangerous breach of privacy. \"They are not asking apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products. They\'re simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device,\" said White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest in a press conference earlier this week.

WVUA 23 spoke with a Criminal Justice Professor and Academic Director of the Joint Electronic Crimes Task Force at the University of Alabama, Diana Dolliver to get a better grasp about this particular case and what Apple has to do to defend themselves along with what the outcome might be if the company doesn\'t cooperate with the court order and the FBI.

Dolliver said, the argument to the right to privacy and encryption doesn\'t really apply to this case. \"In the case of terrorism or criminals they don\'t have that reasonable expectation to privacy that you and I do and so that\'s the point of the court.\"
