Recently there was a standoff with an Oregon militia taking over a federal building and then subsequently leading law enforcement on a chase that ended in the shooting of LaVoy Finicum. New footage has just been released of the event recorded by a militia member in the back seat of Finicum’s vehicle. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Newly-emerged video shows the final moments of Oregon militia member Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum\'s life.

The 12-minute video — released by The Oregonian — was recorded inside Finicum\'s truck on Jan. 26. The group was staying at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge during a 41-day showdown with federal agents.

\"You can go ahead and shoot me,\" the 54-year-old Arizona rancher says, taunting authorities. \"Boys, this is gonna get real. You want my blood on your hands? Get it done. Because we got people to see and places to go.””*

Members of an anti-government militia have occupied the headquarters of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in a remote region of eastern Oregon for over a week, protesting what they claim is an overreaching federal government. The occupation is being led by Ammon Bundy and his brother Ryan, two sons of Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher best known for an armed standoff with the federal government in 2014 over a cattle grazing dispute.

The protest was sparked by the re-sentencing of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven, to five years in a federal prison for deliberately starting fires on their property that spread to the bordering Malheur Wildlife Refuge.

While the media has referred to the situation as an armed standoff, more specifically, the \"Oregon Standoff,\" the federal authorities have kept their distance, and the local authorities, led by Harney County Sheriff David Ward, are also treading lightly.

VICE News traveled to Harney County, Oregon to meet with militia leaders, attend town hall meetings, and speak with local ranchers whom the protesters claim to be representing.

Robert LaVoy Finicum, 54, was killed as police tried to arrest key figures in the refuge takeover. His death on Jan. 26 spurred claims that police acted without provocation, with some labeling his death a murder. The FBI has said Finicum was shot after he tried to elude police and reached for a gun.

The Deschutes County Sheriff\'s Office investigated the shooting, recently turning over results to Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris. He was asked to oversee the investigation by Tim Colahan, Harney County district attorney, to provide an independent assessment. The shooting occurred in Harney County.

While most of us were exchanging Christmas gifts and celebrating the start of a new year, Oregon Ranchers Dwight Hammond, Jr., 73, and his son, Steven Hammond, 46, were preparing for a return to prison on January 4th, 2016.

Among other things, the Hammonds were charged with various counts of Arson on federal property – punishable by a five-year mandatory minimum sentence according to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. 

On January 2nd, an estimated 300 Hammond family supporters – including Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy – held a peaceful protest against what they called the unconstitutional treatment of the ranchers.

While the peaceful protest continued, Ammon Bundy and other armed individuals left, entering and occupying the Bureau of Land Management’s Malheur Wildlife Refuge headquarters, which had been closed for the holiday.

Following the occupation, Ammon Bundy said the refuge’s creation was “an unconstitutional act,” and called for the release of the Hammonds and for the federal government to relinquish control of the area. 

“This is about the federal government controlling the land and resources, and putting whole counties and whole states in economic duress, this is about violations of human rights, about the federal government not even caring about what is in the Constitution.”

Tensions came to a head last night as authorities and militia members were involved in a shooting during a traffic stop. Eight militia members have been arrested and one is confirmed dead. After police shot and killed one of the militia members and arrested of eight of their comrades, the remaining members are threatening a “bloodbath” if the F.B.I. moves in on them. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola hosts of The Young Turks break it down.

Do you think the authorities handled this situation the right way? Let us know in the comments below.

“Oregon standoff spokesman Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum was killed and other leaders of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation were arrested Tuesday after the FBI and state police stopped vehicles about 20 miles north of Burns.

Authorities did not release the name of the person who died at the highway stop, but Finicum\'s daughter confirmed it was Finicum, 55, of Cane Beds, Arizona, one of the cowboy-hat wearing faces of the takeover.

\"My dad was such a good good man, through and through,\" said Arianna Finicum Brown, 26, one of Finicum\'s 11 children. \"He would never ever want to hurt somebody, but he does believe in defending freedom and he knew the risks involved.\"

Oregon (i/ˈɔrɨɡən/ ORR-ə-gən) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located on the Pacific coast, with Washington to the north, California to the south, Nevada on the southeast and Idaho to the east. The Columbia and Snake rivers delineate much of Oregon's northern and eastern boundaries, respectively. The area was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before the arrival of traders, explorers, and settlers who formed an autonomous government in Oregon Country in 1843. The Oregon Territory was created in 1848, and Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859.
Oregon is the 9th most extensive and the 27th most populous of the 50 United States. Salem is the state's capital and third-most-populous city; Portland is the most populous. Portland is the 29th-largest U.S. city, with a population of 583,776 (2010 US Census) and a metro population of 2,241,841 (2009 estimate), the 23rd-largest U.S. metro area. The valley of the Willamette River in western Oregon is the state's most densely populated area and is home to eight of the ten most populous cities.
