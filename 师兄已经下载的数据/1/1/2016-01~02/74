New DISGUSTING Law Seizes Refugee Assets - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 28, 2016Leave a Comment
The Danish parliament has adopted a new policy of seizing property from asylum-seekers should they want to enter their country and live there. They can even take any valuables worth more than $1500. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“On Tuesday, the Danish parliament overwhelmingly passed a bill seemingly designed to solidify Denmark’s reputation as Western Europe’s least attractive country for refugees—a hard-earned title at a time when many of its neighbors are tightening border controls as people continue to flee conflicts in the Middle East, North Africa, and elsewhere. The law empowers Danish authorities to seize any assets exceeding $1,450 from asylum-seekers in order to help pay for the migrants’ subsistence in the country (items of “sentimental value,” such as wedding rings, are exempt). It also extends, from one year to three, the period that those who are resettled must wait to apply for family members to join them in Denmark.”*
