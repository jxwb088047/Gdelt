41-Day Oregon Standoff Ends With Surrender, Arrest Of Final Four Protestors - Worldnews.com

The 41-day standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge ended Thursday when the four remaining protesters were arrested without incident, multiple news reports said.

The first three protesters surrendered to FBI agents two hours prior to the surrender of the fourth man, Al Jazeera reported.

 
 
 
 
 
 The four protesters were indicted last week, together with 12 others previously arrested on charges of conspiring to impede federal officers during the standoff at the compound.

Protesters took over the Malheur National Wildlife Reserve on Jan. 2 blaming the occupation on the return to prison of two Oregon farmers convicted of setting fires that spread to federal property in the vicinity of the refuge near Bend, Ore.

The wildlife reserve occupation was led by Ammon Bundy, and was also directed as a protest against federal control over millions of acres of public land in western United States.

Bundy and 10 others were arrested in January in Oregon, most of them during a confrontation with the FBI and state police on a snow-covered roadside where a spokesman for the group, Robert "LaVoy" Finicum, was shot dead. A 12th member of the group turned himself in to police in Arizona.

In the US state of Oregon, two farmers have turned themselves in to police, and have been moved to a federal facility in California.

Their plight has inspired members of self-styled armed militias to occupy a government property and are refusing to leave.

Three of the last four armed protesters occupying a national wildlife refuge in Oregon surrendered today. The final holdout is vowing to remain at the refuge up until his grievances are heard. Tensions were high at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in remote eastern Oregon. The standoff began 41 days ago as a protest over federal land control in the West. The protest was led by Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy. The Bundy\'s have a decades long dispute with the government over federal control of the west.

Gun-toting protesters remained holed up in a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon on Monday night even though the two men whose prison sentences sparked their action turned themselves into authorities and repudiated the protest.

The protesters said they wouldn\'t budge until the government addresses their demands, but the FBI said it was hoping to bring a \"peaceful\" end to the standoff at the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

\"We feel we have exhausted all prudent measures and have been ignored,\" said Ammon Bundy, co-leader of the self-styled Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, who said the group wants the federal government to \"remove its unlawful presence in this county.\"

Bundy\'s group seized the government property after splintering off from a larger protest about ranchers\' rights in the small town of Burns.

The initial protest in Burns was in support of Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven, 46, who faced more jail time for setting fires that spread to government land after their initial sentences were extended by about four years each. The Hammonds surrendered Monday at the federal prison in San Pedro, California.

While Bundy claimed to be acting in behalf of the Hammonds, the ranchers distanced themselves from the protesters, and their lawyer told police that \"neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family.\"

Harney County Sheriff David Ward directly addressed those at the refuge during a news conference Monday, telling them: \"It\'s time for you to leave our community, go home to your families and leave this communit...

\"The armed militia takeover of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is over: The final holdout at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge turned himself in to the FBI after earlier saying he will “die a free man.”

David Fry walked out of the refuge and into custody, ending the standoff 41 days after it began. He gave himself up after calling on people to say Hallelujah.

“I heard hallelujahs from the SWAT team. I heard hallelujahs in unison from an entire building that was watching that, hoping to God they could get everybody out alive,” Dave Ward, the sheriff of Harney County, said later.

Fry was the lone holdout for part of Thursday after his three companions surrendered to the FBI earlier. Speaking via telephone to his supporters, in a conversation that was broadcast online, Fry appeared to be disturbed over a variety of issues, including the federal government, UFOs, and marijuana. And, he said, he will not leave.”*

The four holdouts in the armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon surrendered on Thursday, with the last protester repeatedly threatening suicide in a dramatic final phone call with mediators before he gave up, ending the 41-day standoff.

David Fry, 27, stayed behind for more than an hour and told supporters by phone he had not agreed with the other three to leave the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon. The call was broadcast live on an audio feed posted on the Internet.

\"I\'m actually pointing a gun at my head. I\'m tired of living,\" Fry said during the phone call. He later added: \"Until you address my grievances, you\'re probably going to have to watch me be killed, or kill myself.\"

Fry sounded alternately defiant and tormented during the rambling final call, veering from rants about the federal government to his thoughts on UFOs. He surrendered after taking a final cigarette and cookie and asking his mediators to shout \"Hallelujah.\"

Authorities could be heard over the phone line telling him to put his hands up before the call disconnected. Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward called him a \"very troubled young man\" at a news conference several hours later.

Federal authorities said the refuge would remain closed for several weeks as agents secured what was now considered a crime scene and scoured it for fugitives or explosives.

The protesters told authorities they left behind booby traps but did not say whether the trip wires and other devices would trigger explosions, a law enforcement official told Reuters....

The FBI has released a video from the Tuesday traffic stop that led to the shooting death of one of the armed protesters who had been occupying the headquarters of a federal wildlife preserve in Oregon.
The video is intended to counteract some of the contradictory accounts of what happened and give an unfiltered view of the incident, which ended with the death of rancher LaVoy Finicum.

Some accounts have argued that Finicum was surrendering to police with his hands up before he was shot, while another stated he was on his knees. Law enforcement has claimed he was refusing to surrender....
