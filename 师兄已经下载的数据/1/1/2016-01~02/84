China, Russia simplify direct road transport formalities - China News - SINA English
URUMQI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- A permit for international road transportation between China and Russia via Kazakhstan without customs declaration in there took effect Tuesday.
Yleham Abulet, director of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous regional road transportation administrative bureau, said that before the permit, Xinjiang's road transport could only reach neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Goods transported from Xinjiang to Russia had to pass through Kazakhstan as there is no crossing on the China-Russia border in Xinjiang. All the goods transported between China and Russia via Xinjiang were unloaded in Kazakhstan for customs checks, Yleham Abulet said.
With the permit, cargo trucks only need to register when they transport via Kazakhstan, he added.
"Cargo trucks used to spend one week on a one-way trip to Russia. Now, transport time could be shortened to two days," said Tursungul, general manager of Xinjiang Xinde International Transportation Co., Ltd.
China and Russia have been working on direct international road transportation since 2009. The permit will play an important role in the development of bilateral trade between the two countries.
