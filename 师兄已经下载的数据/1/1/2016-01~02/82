an individual serving 13 years for possessing two marijuana joints applied for clemency and was recently denied. The reason behind the denial was he had not yet served 10 years in prison. Bernard’s sentence is a prime example of the draconian nature of the marijuana laws in many states across the country. In stark contrast to Louisiana, many states have decriminalized...
“Where to Invade Next” redefines American exceptionalism. The film asserts, persuasively and passionately, that the United States is exceptional not because it is superior, but rather because it seems to be the only civilized country in the world that treats its citizens so callously. The latest documentary from Michael Moore is an essential act of rebellion, a movie that...
Leftist provocateur Michael Moore drops the angrily strident tone of “Fahrenheit 9/11’’ and “Sicko,’’ and attempts to preach beyond the converted with “Where To Invade Next,’’ a feature-length infomercial for socialism in the more playfully funny mode of his classic “Bowling for Columbine’’ (which won the documentary Oscar) and “Roger & Me.’’ While the title sounds like a...
A documentary based on the benefits of invading other countries sounds like an unlikely premise for Michael Moore, the controversial filmmaker and antiwar activist who slammed the U.S. invasion of Iraq a decade ago in Fahrenheit 9/11. But his latest movie, Where to Invade Next, relies on the concept of a metaphorical, not a physical, attack. Moore, parading as a one-man army...

Where to Invade Next is not an expose of the Perma-War nature of 21st Century American Imperialism, as...
It's been a groundbreaking month in the national dialogue about opiate dependency and addiction. From halls of government to family living rooms, the country is positioning for a dramatic shift in attitudes about drug policy that might finally mean an end to the drug war in favor of a public health and human rights approach. In early February, a series of bills were introduced...
Academy award winning filmmaker Michael Moore stopped by Google to discuss his latest film, \"Where to Invade Next.\"

\"Where to Invade Next\" is an expansive, rib-tickling, and subversive comedy in which Moore, playing the role of \'invader,\' visits a host of nations to learn how the U.S. could improve its own prospects. The creator of \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" and \"Bowling for Columbine\" is back with this hilarious and eye-opening call to arms. Turns out the solutions to America’s most entrenched problems already exist in the world—they’re just waiting to be co-opted.

In theaters February 12, 2016.

\"Political documentarian Michael Moore has repeatedly expressed his frustrations with President Obama, but this week he really stuck the knife in, saying in an interview that Obama will be remembered as the first black president and “that’s it.”
Moore spoke with The Hollywood Reporter at the Toronto Film Festival (which Moore attended to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Roger & Me) and said that despite what Obama may have claimed in 2012, he “did not save Detroit.” Moore admitted that while Obama’s done many good things, “he’s been a huge disappointment.”\"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

From Roger and Me (1989) to the Oscar-winning Bowling for Columbine (2002), Michael Moore\'s work has been entertaining, satirizing and provoking. Where to Invade Next ​is an expansive, rib-tickling and subversive comedy in which Moore, playing the role of “invader,” visits nine​ nations to learn how the U.S. could improve its own prospects. It turns out the solutions to America’s most entrenched problems already exist in the world: ​they’re just waiting to be co-opted.

Michael Francis Moore (born April 23, 1954) is an American filmmaker, author, social critic and activist. He is the director and producer of Fahrenheit 9/11, which is the highest-grossing documentary of all time. His films Bowling for Columbine and Sicko also place in the top ten highest-grossing documentaries. In September 2008, he released his first free movie on the Internet, Slacker Uprising, which documented his personal quest to encourage more Americans to vote in presidential elections. He has also written and starred in the TV shows TV Nation and The Awful Truth.
Moore criticizes globalization, large corporations, assault weapon ownership, U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the Iraq War, the American health care system, and capitalism in his written and cinematic works.
Moore was born in Flint, Michigan, and raised in Davison, a suburb of Flint, by parents Veronica (née Wall), a secretary, and Frank Moore, an automotive assembly-line worker. At that time, the city of Flint was home to many General Motors factories, where his parents and grandfather worked. His uncle LaVerne was one of the founders of the United Automobile Workers labor union and participated in the Flint Sit-Down Strike.
