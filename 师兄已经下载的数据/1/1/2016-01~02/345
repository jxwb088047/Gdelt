China is grappling with an extreme cold front, which has swept across almost the entire country, bringing temperatures to well below freezing and strong winds too.
Most places in China have already seen six to ten degrees of temperature drop, with many experiencing record lows. Temperatures in the coldest place in the country, in Inner Mongolia, dropped to close to minus 50 degrees. As the cold wave moves further south, temperatures are expected to fall by six to ten degrees.
In Harbin, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, temperatures dropped to 30 degrees below zero Centigrade. Penguins at the zoo fluff their feathers to shake off the cold.In Xinjiang, close to the China-Mongolia border, the lowest temperature went to minus 35. A small cat snuggles close to two sheep to keep warm.In the Dandong section of the Yalv River in northeast China's Liaoning Province, large ice floes have appeared. "I haven't seen this for years for like ten years. Ice floes become frozen in the morning, and the sun at noon usually melts them," said local resident.Even seawater has frozen trapping a dozen fishing boats along the coast in Laizhou Bay in east China's Shandong Peninsula.Â  Local authorities have called off sea operations near the frozen areas. Traffic has also been affected. In central China's Anhui Province, more than 1000 cars were stranded on a national highway for hours due to icy road conditions.In southwest China's Yunnan Province, snow and rainstorms caused traffic delays on several highways. The average temperature in south China's Guangdong Province has fallen to below ten degrees, with several places seeing sleet.
