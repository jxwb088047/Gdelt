Hillary Clinton calls for end to Mexican illegals deportation raids
Leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has called for an end to deportation raids targeting Mexican families living in the U.S. ILLEGALLY.

Mrs. Clinton said the raids \"have sown fear and division in immigrant communities across the country\". Immigration has been one of the leading issues in the 2016 race.

Now the facts:

More than two million undocumented migrants have been deported from the U.S. during Obama’s stay in power. But 11 million more have been living ILLEGALLY in the U.S. for some time.

Thousands are coming over the border with Mexico every week.

Now look what happened in Germany when Chancellor Merkel let ISIS refugees settle in Germany. Days later, they abused, assaulted, molested and raped 500 women in ONE NIGHT! German police tried to cover this embarrassment up and ISIS refugees were chanting that Chancellor Merkel invited them and the police can’t deport them now!

Wake up people! Know who you’re voting for!

Bernie Sanders and Martin O\'Malley on Thursday blasted a report that said the Department of Homeland Security is planning raids that would target families of undocumented immigrants from Central American countries for deportation. The Washington Post reported late Wednesday that the nationwide raids will focus on hundreds of families that have entered the United States since early last year. The plan is the first large-scale effort to deport families that have fled violence in Central America, the Post reported. Sanders said in a statement he was \"disappointed\" by the plan. O\'Malley, who is running well behind Sanders and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, said the plan is \"completely at odds with our character as a nation.\"

Hillary Clinton says \"no,\" she is not going to be the next deporter-in-chief, a nickname given to President Obama by a Latino group that opposes deportations. The issue came to a head over the holidays, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement began rounding up and deporting adults with children who entered this country illegally after May 2014. \"This should come as no surprise,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement. \"I have said publicly for months that individuals who constitute enforcement priorities, including families and unaccompanied children, will be removed.\" The raids prompted outrage among some Democrats and their Hispanic allies. \"I have come out against the raids,\" Clinton told Fusion Monday night. \"I do not think the raids are an appropriate tool to enforce the immigration laws. In fact, I think they are divisive, they are sowing discord and fear.

\"And I also have come out in favor of guaranteeing that unaccompanied children have government-sponsored counsel, so that as they go through the process, they will not be lost in the process, confused by the process, and will have a chance to tell their story.\" Clinton said Congress must pass comprehensive immigration reform. \"But how we implement our immigration laws does have some ability for the executive to make choices. And I would prioritize criminals, people who are plotting or planning or taking action that is against our public safety or our property -- those are the kinds of people who would be on my list.\" Those people are on the Obama administration\'s list of deportables, along wit...

Protesters took to the streets of New York City with a message of “F*** I.C.E.” today to protest President Obama and the administration’s move to start deporting illegal immigrants from Central America. Protesters reportedly directed their anger at President Obama for allowing the deportations to go forward and Hillary Clinton for “supporting the coup” in Honduras. Apparently, blocking traffic and inconveniencing people is now the go-to strategy for all social justice warriors.

Hillary Clinton said she is against federal agents raiding undocumented immigrant families’ homes. 
The former Secretary of State said last night at Fusion’s Brown & Black Democratic Presidential Forum that she is okay with deporting immigrant children on a case-by-case basis but doesn’t support using raids to apprehend them. Her comments come in the wake of a series of raids conducted by the Department of Homeland Security targeting families who fled Central America in 2014.
Clinton told the panel of questioners, 
“Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly children, due process and have their story told. And a lot of children will of course have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.”
She added that she opposes raids on immigrants’ homes.

“They are divisive,” she said. “They are sowing discord and fear.”

Using the exact same words, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders said they \"will not deport children\" -- or most other illegal immigrants -- from the USA. In fact, both candidates said they are willing to go further than President Obama has gone to keep more illegal aliens in the country. At another debate Wednesday night, this one hosted by The Washington Post and Univision, Clinton said she has been \"consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship\" for many years. She also promised to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship in the first 100 days of her presidency. Clinton said she\'s committed to \"defending\" DAPA and DACA, President Obama\'s temporary amnesty for millions of children and parents who are in this country illegally. \"I\'m committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law,\" Clinton said.

(Republicans say the law does not allow President Obama to go as far as he has gone, and the Supreme Court is now considering Obama\'s attempt to give temporary work permits and Social Security numbers to millions of illegal immigrants.) Clinton urged the debate audience to \"imagine where we would be today if we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.\" Pressing Clinton on the issue, moderator Jorge Ramos asked Clinton, \"Can you promise tonight that you won\'t deport childr...

We won\'t have to wait until after the election for a fresh reminder of what a war hawk Hillary Clinton is. She\'s already used the Paris terrorist attacks as a justification for increasing ground troops in Syria. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Hillary Clinton distanced herself from Barack Obama’s strategy for defeating Islamic State extremists on Thursday in a sweeping foreign policy speech that called for greater use of American ground troops and an intensified air campaign.

Though ruling out deploying the tens of thousands of US troops seen in Iraq andAfghanistan, the former of secretary of state made clear she would take a notably more hawkish approach than the current administration if she is elected president.

“The United States has been conducting this fight for more than a year; it’s time to be begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts,” Clinton told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.”*

On the radio John Gambling Radio Show show in February 2003 Hillary Clinton said:

“We’ve got to do several things and I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.”

“I made this exception basically on humanitarian grounds because of the individual story but certainly we’ve got to do more at our borders. And people have to stop employing illegal immigrants.”

“Come up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx — you’re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work.”

“For me, this is about what kind of people we all are and what kind of country we have. And I am absolutely convinced that this is in our economic interest, it’s in the interest of our values and it’s even in the interest of our long term security as a nation.”

“So, you know where I stand and there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can as President and during this campaign to make this case.”

There may be a ticking time-bomb for the Hillary Clinton campaign: corruption being exposed in the FBI’s investigation of her emails. Fox News reported that the feds think they might have something and are bolstering their investigation. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"The FBI is widening its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was U.S. secretary of state to determine whether any public corruption laws were violated, Fox News reported on Monday.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been looking into whether classified material was mishandled during Clinton’s tenure at the State Department from 2009-2013.

It will expand its probe by examining possible overlap of the Clinton Foundation charity with State Department business, Fox reported, citing three unidentified intelligence officials.

“The (FBI) agents are investigating the possible intersection of Clinton Foundation donations, the dispensation of State Department contracts and whether regular processes were followed,” Fox quoted one of its unidentified sources as saying.

The FBI and the State Department had no immediate comment on the report.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus issued a statement calling the Fox News report “a very troubling development.””*

New York junior Senator and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had expressed interest in the 2008 United States presidential election since at least October 2002, drawing media speculation on whether she would become a candidate. No woman has ever won the nomination of a major party in the history of U.S. presidential elections.
On January 20, 2007, she announced that she was forming an exploratory committee and filed with the Federal Election Commission to seek the nomination of the Democratic Party. Subsequently she began fundraising and campaigning activities. For several months Clinton led opinion polls among Democratic candidates by substantial margins until Senator Barack Obama pulled close to or even with her. Clinton then regained her polling lead, winning many polls by double digits; by autumn 2007 she was leading all other Democratic candidates by wide margins in national polls. She placed third in the Iowa caucus to Barack Obama and John Edwards, and trailed considerably in polls shortly thereafter in New Hampshire before staging a comeback and finishing first in the primary there.
