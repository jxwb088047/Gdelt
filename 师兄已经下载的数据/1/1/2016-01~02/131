A 14-year-old North Texas boy will not face charges after he was suspended over a homemade clock that teachers, administrators and police found suspicious.

Ahmed Mohamed, who is Muslim, was arrested at MacArthur High School in Irving on Monday afternoon.

He said he enjoys tinkering with electronics and took the clock to school to show his engineering teacher. But an alarm on the clock went off in English class and his teacher confiscated it.

"I told them it's a clock. And they told me, 'Why would you bring a clock to school?' And I was like to tell time. And the officer said, 'There's clocks here, clocks here, clocks around you everywhere.' And I told him that I wanted to impress my teachers so that I could feel appreciated for it, but instead I got the police called on me," he said.

Police searched his belongings and removed him from school in handcuffs.

Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said Mohamed originally was not very forthcoming and the school was concerned that the device was possibly the infrastructure for a bomb. Officers acted in an abundance of caution.

“It was a very suspicious device. We live in an age where you can't take things like that to school. Of course we've seen across our country horrific things happen. We have to err on the side of caution," Boyd said.

In the state of Texas a person can be found guilty of possessing a hoax bomb if the device is intended to bring fear. But, police no longer believe Mohamed’s device is dangerous and he will not be charged.

"We found no evidence to support the perception that he intended to create alarm," Boyd said.

Ezra Levant of TheRebel.Media asks, did you see that story about the 14-year-old kid in Dallas, Ahmed Mohamed, who made a home-made clock, took it to school but because he’s a Muslim, his teacher called the principal and they called the cops who arrested him, interrogated him and suspended him because they thought he was making a bomb?

But what about my take on the story? That the kid didn’t make a clock at all. He made something look as bomb-like as possible, on purpose, and brought it to school. All his teacher told him was, don’t walk around with it in case it worries people. But Ahmed did that anyhow. He took it to another class where the alarm went off, making that teacher suspicious, just like he knew it would. Then he was passive aggressive with the cops, who immediately pegged him as a hoaxer.

What if, just like his dad, a crazy fake sheikh who ran for president of Sudan and who participates in incendiary stunts, he’s a media hound?

Oh — and his sister was suspended for allegedly making bomb threats, too.

No wonder this boy is being invited to the White House. If Obama finds out the whole story, he’ll probably appoint Ahmed as an ambassador.

That’s why leftists love him. Not because of what really happened. But because of what they can say happened, to shame and blame America.

The Texas teen, who was arrested after school officials mistook his homemade digital clock for a bomb, says he wants to be an engineer.
This video shows that the supposed clock invention by a 14 year old is in fact not an invention. The 'clock' is a commercial bedside alarm clock removed from its casing. There is nothing to indicate that the clock was even assembled by the child. I suspect this was brought into school to create an alarmed reaction. 

So, Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. President, Make Magazine (which should know better), and others: You've been duped. Please do recognize youths of all backgrounds who create wonderful inventions with electronics. The kid making press around the world did not invent or build a clock.
Tonight on "The Kelly File," Judge Andrew Napolitano reacted to allegations that Texas teenager Ahmed Mohamed did not create a clock and instead simply took apart an existing clock and transplanted the guts into a pencil box.
In the case of Ahmed Mohamed, the muslim student arrested for bringing a clock to school, we here at TYT told you conservatives would start attacking him. Cue Sarah Palin… Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said on Saturday that arresting and suspending Ahmed Mohamed, the ninth grader who brought a homemade clock to school, was totally reasonable.

Palin called initial media reports of Mohamed's arrest "fishy" and said that school officials were totally justified in thinking that his clock, made out of a pencil box, was a bomb.

"Yep, believing that's a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history," she wrote in a Facebook post in which she shared pictures of her kids' pencil boxes. "Right. That's a clock, and I'm the Queen of England.””*

Ahmed Mohamed, the fourteen-year-old student who was detained for bringing a clock to school, is moving to Qatar to continue his education. Conservative media still won’t cut him a break. John Iadarola (Think Tank), Jayar Jackson, and Elliot Hill (The Lip TV) hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"Mohamed and his family will move from Irving to Qatar in the near future. Mohamed had visited the country, along with Saudi Arabia, earlier this monthamid a whirlwind of publicity surrounding his story, and toured the Qatar Foundation’s facilities. The foundation has partnerships with several Western universities, including Carnegie Mellon, Texas A&M, and Northwestern, which have satellite campuses there.”*

The National is CBC Television's flagship news program. Airing seven days a week, the show delivers news, feature documentaries and analysis from some of Canada's leading journalists.
Teen inventor Ahmed Mohamed, who was arrested after taking a homemade clock to school, has been invited to the White House to visit President Barack Obama during the president's annual astronomy night.
This video challenges that Ahmed Mohamed's clock was homemade by showing a nearly identical package being prepared in about twenty seconds (screws and simple fasteners were excluded for brevity here). Similar results can be extrapolated for the student's claims about CPU, USB hub," media player", and remote control. Opinion follows.

Consider for comparison, a disruptive bomb hoax at a nearby school one week prior. It was investigated without knowing the ethnicity of the perpetrator. http://educationblog.dallasnews.com/2015/09/messages-warning-of-bomb-and-isis-spray-painted-on-dallas-isd-school.html/ In that case the threat was a message made of "just" spray paint.

Shortly after 9/11, and the nearby bomb hoax, a student from a begrudged family wanted to make an impression on his school with the repackaging of a dismantled clock. It was not a school project, but the kid showed it to multiple teachers with varying degrees of disruption. Many adults would be able to envision the package plainly as this video shows. Eventually, the student's behavior with the device was challenged as being contrary to the school's Code of Conduct. The package ended up being reporting as a suspicious device. Rightly, it was NOT reported as a bomb, but the "possible infrastructure for a bomb". The boy claimed that he expected his teachers to be impressed that he made a clock, but since he didn't make a clock, that's an unfair expectation.

The big hoax: A version of the boy's story was spread, propelled by a claim of discrimination. The publicity reinvented the boy as a legendary inventor, and the ideal student by big tech names. The suspicious device in the story was recast as a “cool clock” worthy of praise by the White House. Belief in the clock was a litmus test of sorts in a Presidential debate. Gifts were showered, the world tour began. It became a Cinderella story, but the carriage is just a pumpkin. The cool clock is just a dismantled clock. The boy hadn't been shown to have made anything of interest. Discrimination wasn't proven. Duped.

Team Ahmed has the student formalize his claim of inventing the clock from scraps around the house:

Team Ahmed allows the student to claim he made CPUs and soldered them.

Thomas Talbot explains why the term "homemade clock" should not be used for the student's package:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEmSwJTqpgY

Some oversimplifications:
“It's a clock.” This is a deceptive oversimplification. The story centers around the student wanting to make an impression. His product was an impression. It was never intended to be dismissed as "just a clock". His redecoration is fundamental to both sides of the story.
“It's not a bomb.” Obvious to many, but the concern was about the “possible infrastructure for a bomb.” Some threats use innuendos that might not be understood by outsiders. We don't have the schools full story.
“It's a clock.” We'll yeah, of sorts, but with a family grudge over the school district's handling of a prior bomb concern, don't antagonize the school by telling them you made the unsolicited device for them shortly after 9/11 to make an impression. Put it away if advised, and certainly don't plug it in and set the alarm to go off during class.
"He was traumatized." Well, he did say that it was kind of cool being handcuffed.
"It's a conspiracy." Well, it can be, but it can also be opportunists constantly at the ready and bad reporting.
“It's a clock.” We'll yeah, of sorts, but don't put it under anybody's car (student did not do this) Context matters.

The thrift store clock used in this video was Advance model 4081 c. 2002 with 1.8” digits and 6” wide display.
Another thrift store clock gave similar results https://youtu.be/sSK9AnXrdKs. 
Clocks like Cosmotime e-805 or Radioshack catalog item 63-765(A) c. 1986 may give results like this: http://imgur.com/drGpVJL

On Monday 9/14, Ahmed Mohammed, a 14-year-old Texan kid, made the national headlines after he was suspended from school for bringing an alarm clock he had supposedly built himself. Later Barack Obama tweeted "Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great." As is to be expected, there is far more to this story! #IStandWithAhmed
