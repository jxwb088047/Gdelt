Badly Berned, Hillary Clinton Attempts To Go On Offense - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 14, 2016Leave a Comment
Now that Bernie Sanders has caught and passed Hillary Clinton in Iowa, and he had already been beating her in New Hampshire, panic has set in at Clinton headquarters. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Hillary Clinton used to avoid uttering the name of her main rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt). But that phase of the race has definitively ended, with Clinton and her team staging a multi-pronged attack on Sanders in the first weeks of the new year.
The most recent anti-Sanders salvo came last week. The Clinton campaign had highlighted Sanders’ votes to give gun suppliers legal immunity previously, but took the opportunity to re-focus scrutiny on the senator’s gun record after President Barack Obama wrote in a New York Times op-ed Thursday evening that he would not endorse any candidate who disagreed with him on gun reform, like repealing the immunity law. When Sanders’ campaign said that there was “zero daylight” between the senator and Obama on gun control on Friday, Clinton’s campaign pounced.”*
