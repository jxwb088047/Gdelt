Cruz pulls merch created by controversial street artist | TheHill
Republican presidential contender Ted CruzTed CruzAnti-Trump group targets Mormons with ad featuring nude Melania Trump predicts he'll 'easily' get delegates to win nomination Ron Paul: 'Republican or Democrat, the people lose’ MORE has taken down some promotional items from his online store that were created by a controversial street artist.
The move comes after a recent segment on the liberal news show "The Young Turks" that highlighted some inflammatory tweets from the artist known only as Sabo.
TO A NIGGER A BLACK LIFE DON'T AMOUNT TO SHIT MUCH LESS MATTERS!https://t.co/tw6Y5MvhqG
"Ted Cruz is proud of this guy," the show's host, Cenk Uygur, said in the episode.
Sabo's most notable work was a poster of the Texas senator shirtless and covered in tattoos. Cruz has touted the image on the campaign trail in an attempt to show his lighter side.
The conservative artist frequently makes incendiary comments on Twitter, freely using the n-word and attacking the Black Lives Matter movement.
On Tuesday he lashed out at the Cruz campaign for pulling his merchandise and blamed "The Young Turks" episode for their "hit piece" on him.
TEAM CRUZ BENT TO THE YOUNG TURKS AND TOOK ME OFF THEIR SITE. THE HIT PIECE IS USED TO SELL SHEPARD FAIRIES SAD DESIGN FOR BERNIE SANDERS.
A spokesperson for the Cruz campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
