In the wake of the shooting of LaVoy FInicum, what should happen to his compatriots? Would it be handled differently if they weren’t white or if they were Muslim? Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz, John Iadarola (ThinkTank), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show) hosts of The Young Turks break it down.
Do you think everyone should be charged with Finicum’s murder? Let us know in the comments below.
“What went wrong when Oregon State Police and the FBI tried to arrest leaders of the illegal occupation at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge?
During the traffic stop on Tuesday, police managed to arrest five militia members, including leader Ammon Bundy, without much trouble. But the incident ended with another, LaVoy Finicum, shot and killed. Initially, details were sparse, and police wouldn’t even confirm that Finicum was the man they had shot. But late Thursday they released video, shot from a plane, of the incident that clarifies some of what happened. This is an edited version, but the full, nearly 27-minute video, is here.”
