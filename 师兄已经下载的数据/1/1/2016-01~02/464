Recently Donald Trump had to cancel a rally due to overwhelming protests. Sarah Palin and Stacey Dash have rushed to his defense. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Fox contributor and actress Stacey Dashmade the case on her Patheos blog that Donald Trump isn’t condoning violence, he’s just “street” from his tough New York City upbringing.

“There’s a lot of talk about Donald Trump being violent, condoning it, or at least inciting it,” Dash begins. “But this is a total misread of our next President. First of all, he’s not responsible for what every random guy does — out of thousands.”

“Second of all, he’s not violent, he’s just ‘street,\'” she continues. “He was born in Queens.”
Dash readily admitted that Trump had a privileged background and wasn’t “hustling on the street, dodging bullets… But there is something about growing up in New York, a certain toughness instilled, a certain level of ‘street’ that can’t be ignored.””*

\"Iowa Republicans voiced scepticism on Monday over Sarah Palin’s claim to be contemplating a campaign for president in 2016, amid criticism of her unusual speech to a conservative rally in the state.

The former Alaska governor and vice-presidential nominee revived speculation about her future over the weekend by twice telling reporters that she was interested in running for the White House next year, before addressing the Freedom Summit in Des Moines.

However, her disjointed 33-minute speech – in which she described President Barack Obama as an “overgrown little boy who is acting kinda spoiled”, and declared “the man can only ride you when your back is bent” – received poor reviews even from some conservatives.\"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

Sarah Louise Palin i/ˈpeɪlɨn/ (née Heath; born February 11, 1964) is an American politician, commentator and author. As the Republican Party nominee for Vice President in the 2008 presidential election, she was the first Alaskan on the national ticket of a major party and first Republican woman nominated for the vice presidency. Her book Going Rogue has sold more than two million copies. Since January 2010, she has provided political commentary for Fox News, and hosted a television show, Sarah Palin's Alaska. Five million viewers tuned in for the first episode, a record for The Learning Channel.
She was elected to Wasilla City Council in 1992 and became mayor of Wasilla in 1996. In 2003, after an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor, she was appointed Chairman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, responsible for overseeing the state's oil and gas fields for safety and efficiency. The youngest person and first woman to be elected Governor of Alaska, Palin held the office from December 2006 until her resignation in July 2009. She has since endorsed and campaigned for the Tea Party movement, as well as several candidates in the 2010 midterm elections. From the time of her Vice Presidential nomination in 2008, Palin was considered a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election until she announced in October 2011 that she would not run.
