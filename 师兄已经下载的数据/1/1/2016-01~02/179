Xinjiang seeing fewer terrorist incidents: Party chief - SINA English
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The frequency of terrorist incidents in Xinjiang has dropped significantly, the autonomous region's Party chief said Tuesday.
"The situation in Xinjiang is becoming ever more stable. Local authorities have strengthened their ability to prevent and fight terrorist activity," said Zhang Chunxian on the sidelines of the annual session of the national legislature.
Local officials and members of the public across Xinjiang's many ethnic groups have actively engaged in the fight against terrorists, he noted.
However, Zhang warned that Xinjiang still faces a tough task to maintain stability. The local government will maintain pressure on terrorists, he added.
