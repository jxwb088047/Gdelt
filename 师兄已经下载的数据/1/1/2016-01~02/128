The NRA was wrong about the Obama-CNN event on guns - Worldnews.com

 Whatever ratings CNN scores with its “Guns in America” town hall meeting staged tonight with President Obama from George Mason University, they’ll be less impressive than what could have been: The 24-7 news network had invited the National Rifle Association to participate in the hourlong event hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper, but the Virginia-based group declined […] ...

DemocracyNow! host Amy Goodman told CNN’s Brian Stelter that his network and most other mainstream media were “manufacturing consent” for Donald Trump by giving him more airtime than other candidates.

On Sunday’s edition of CNN’s Reliable Sources, Goodman called out CNN for broadcasting an empty stage in anticipation of Donald Trump’s press conference on election night last Tuesday without ever mentioning that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders was giving a speech to his supporters at the same time.


“Let’s look at Super Tuesday 3, you had major coverage here at CNN, at MSNBC, at Fox — all the networks across all through he night as the polls are closing,” she recalled. “You see the concession speeches and the great victory speeches, you see Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Kasich, you see Donald Trump. You’re waiting here at CNN, at MSNBC. They said he’s going to hold a news conference… and that’s it.”

“Where was Bernie Sanders?” she wondered. “Well, in fact, Bernie Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona before thousands of people and as the networks were waiting for Donald Trump and waiting and all the pundits are weighing in, they don’t even say that Bernie Sanders is about to speak.”

Goodman pointed out that on another election night, CNN had recorded Hillary Clinton’s victory speech and broadcast it later so that the network could air Trump’s election night press conference where “he sold his steaks and his magazines and his water and everything else.”

“This time, they didn’t even record and show after Bernie Sanders,” she observed. “He was completely absent.”

Ana Kasparian was on CNN’s \"Reliable Sources\" yesterday and lit the house on fire. They brought her on with a Donald Trump supporter for some healthy debate. Ana promptly let CNN know that they are dying because they’re owned by billionaires who control their message and people are getting wise. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Ana Kasparian, host of The Young Turks, schooled conservative CNN guest Scottie Nell Hughes on Sunday for suggesting that Muslims were a bigger problem for Americans than income inequality.

CNN host Brian Stelter posited on Reliable Sources that the media were “deaf” to the frustrations of Americans because they did not understand what it was like to be poor or what it was like to live in rural area.

Kasparian hinted that CNN was not blameless, observing that both the “establishment media” and politicians had been corrupted by the same forces.

“So it’s really difficult for mainstream — let’s say, cable outlets — to talk about things like income inequality, wealth inequality when the advertisers that are funding their shows are the same corporations that want to ensure that the same system continues,” she explained.”*

Cable News Network (CNN) is a U.S. cable news channel founded in 1980 by American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner. Upon its launch, CNN was the first channel to provide 24-hour television news coverage, and the first all-news television channel in the United States. While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta, the Time Warner Center in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. CNN is owned by parent company Time Warner, and the U.S. news channel is a division of the Turner Broadcasting System.
CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. to distinguish the American channel from its international counterpart, CNN International. As of August 2010, CNN is available in over 100 million U.S. households. Broadcast coverage extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms, and the U.S broadcast is also shown in Canada. Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories. Starting late 2010, the domestic version CNN/U.S., is available in high definition to viewers in Japan under the name CNN HD.
