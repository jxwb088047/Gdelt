Scientists Initiate Trial Of Flavonoids In Cotton For Alzheimer's Treatment
Flavonoids or phytonutrients in cotton petals are expected to improve memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Researchers in China have been trying to find out the positive impacts of the flavonoids and the animal models have yielded promising results. Now they have initiated clinical trials to prove that.
Naturally aged mice showed some improvement in memory when flavonoids from cottonpetal were given. The scientists are trying to replicate the same chemical structure in tablets. Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry said they are pursuing the positive impacts of cotton petal flavonoids since 2003.
Flavonoids can protect the human cells from free radicals and can reduce inflammation.
