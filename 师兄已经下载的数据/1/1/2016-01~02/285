If the Republican primary goes all the way to a contested convention, technically anyone could come out of it as the nominee on the Republican side. John Boehner mentioned someone like Paul Ryan. Did he mean someone else? Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Wading into the GOP nominating battle for the first time since leaving office last fall, Boehner said that \"anybody can be nominated\" at the convention in Cleveland this summer.

Boehner, who now splits his time between Florida, Ohio and D.C., had long whispered to friends that he believes Ryan could be the party\'s political savior if it came to that.

But Boehner never said it publicly until now.

In the same question-and-answer session here, Boehner referred to Ted Cruz as \"lucifer.\" He previously called the Texas senator, who led the failed Republican effort to shut down the government over Obamacare, a “jackass.”

Ryan and his staff say he doesn\'t want the nomination.”*

The main GOP establishment strategy to stop Donald trump at this point appears to be trying to organize future caucuses and primaries in a way that would result in a brokered convention. Their Marco Rubio plan malfunctioned. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (ThinkTank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"In private conversations in recent days at a Republican Governors Association retreat here in Park City and at a gathering of conservative policy minds and financiers in Sea Island, Ga., there was an emerging consensus that Trump is vulnerable and that a continued blitz of attacks could puncture the billionaire mogul’s support and leave him limping onto the convention floor.

But the slow-bleed strategy is risky and hinges on Trump losing Florida,Illinois and Ohio on March 15; wins in all three would set him on track to amass the majority of delegates. Even as some party figures see glimmers of hope that Trump can be overtaken, others believe any stop-Trump efforts could prove futile.”*
