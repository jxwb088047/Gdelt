China reduces sentences for 11 Uighurs | Blouin News
A court in western China has reduced the sentences of 11 Uighurs convicted of terrorism and endangering state security, including a naturalized Canadian preacher previously serving a life term.
The new duration of Huseyin Celil's sentence has not been announced, but the decision was lauded by activist John Kamm, who has pressed for Celil's release on behalf of the Canadian government. The official Xinhua News Agency reported late Monday that sentences of 11 Uighurs at Xinjiang's First Prison were commuted but did not specifically name Celil, whose sentence in 2006 drew sharp criticism from Ottawa. Four prisoners, including a man convicted of contacting the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and setting up militant training bases in Afghanistan, saw lengthy prison terms reduced to six months. The Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority in China's far western Xinjiang region. The group has complained of cultural and religious suppression as well as economic marginalization under Chinese rule.
Hundreds of people have been killed in violence in Xinjiang in the past few years. The government blames the unrest on Islamist militants who want to establish an independent state called East Turkestan for minority Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people from Xinjiang who speak a Turkic language. Seven of the convicts had their life sentences reduced to jail terms ranging from 19.5 years to 20 years, including people convicted of instigating "secessionist activities" or participating in terror attacks, Xinhua said late on Tuesday. The other four had their jail terms cut by six months from initial sentences ranging from 8 to 15 years, it added. A spokesman for the main Uighur exile group dismissed the report as "political propaganda".
