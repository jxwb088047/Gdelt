In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiJanuary 5, 2016Leave a Comment
Fox News hates two BLM’s. They call Black Lives Matter a hate group. They also say the Bureau of Land Management is a tyrannical big government overlord. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A law enforcement analyst is under fire for suggesting on CNN that the militia occupying a federal building in rural Oregon are more peaceful than #BlackLivesMatter protesters, because they are “not looting anything”.
The group of self-declared patriots who currently occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Burns, Oregon, says they are defending their God-given entitlement to exploit trees, minerals, and clean water on native and federal lands. They are led by 40-year-old Nevada rancher Ammon Bundy, whose family has been grazing cattle on federal land for 150 years and disputing the payment of land use fees for decades.”*
