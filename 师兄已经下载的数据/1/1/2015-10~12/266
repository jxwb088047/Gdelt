After the attacks in Paris, some in ISIS are emboldened and have uploaded a video threatening further attacks. Specifically on Washington, D.C. We must remain vigilant and not be terrorized. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) warns in a new video that countries, including the U.S., that are taking part in Syrian airstrikes will suffer the same fate as France.
“We say to the states that take part in the crusader campaign that, by God, you will have a day, God willing, like France’s and, by God, as we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington,” a man said in the video,according to Reuters.
The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.”*
