“On Friday’s appearance with Cuomo, things turned ugly quickly after the host pressed the former CEO on her statements, linking them to the Colorado Springs shooter who killed three during an attack on Planned Parenthood.
“Do you feel any sense of regret about how you characterized what was going on at Planned Parenthood after the attack in Colorado?” Cuomo asked. “Because of what the man said which seems as though he was influenced by some of the rhetoric coming out of you and others that painted a very ugly picture and unfair one about Planned Parenthood.”
“Oh, please. Really, Chris?” Fiorina replied, before again restating that the videos were not edited.”*
