China casts doubts on Xinjiang loyalty - ARAB TIMES
BEIJING, Nov 24, (RTRS): A senior official from China’s violence- torn Xinjiang region questioned on Tuesday the loyalty of some ruling Communist Party members there, saying some even supported “terrorist acts”. The comments are a rare admission of dissent among Xinjiang’s officials over Beijing’s policies, which have been condemned by human rights advocates as a major cause for unrest, in the region. China’s government says it faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists in energy-rich Xinjiang, on the border of central Asia, where hundreds have died in violence in recent years.
