China to prosecute ex-head of Xinjiang border guards for suspected graft
Beijing says it will prosecute the former head of the border army regiment in China's mainly Muslim northwestern region of Xinjiang for suspected graft.
In a statement released on Tuesday via the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), China's top anti-graft body, the country's Public Security Ministry said Zhang Genheng had been expelled from both the ruling Communist Party (CPC) and the military.
According to the statement, Zhang will be handed over to authorities and prosecuted for abusing his position and receiving bribes while being the head of the border force in the strategic region.
"Zhang Genheng severely violated organizational and anti-corruption discipline," the ministry said.
About two dozen other officials, including a former deputy head of the bodyguard department and the former head of the border protection team in the country's northern province of Hebei, have also been punished, the statement added, without releasing specific details.
Back in July, Xie Hui, the deputy regional security chief and former head of the prison system, was placed under investigation for suspected corruption.
A crackdown on corruption among state officials began by Chinese President Xi Jinping when he took power in the CPC in late 2012. He became president a year later, and has been continuing to fight corruption.
