Residents Refute Report of ‘Brainwashed’ Suspect in Xinjiang Mine Attack
Residents of northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have rejected claims by state media that one of the alleged perpetrators of a deadly attack at a coal mine had been “brainwashed” with Jihadist rhetoric and that a local police chief was “martyred” while rescuing the suspects’ hostages.The attack occurred on Sept. 18, when a group of knife-wielding suspects set upon security guards at the gate of the Sogan Colliery in Aksu (in Chinese, Akesu) prefecture’s Bay (Baicheng) county, before targeting the mine owner’s residence and a dormitory for workers.Some 50 mostly majority Han Chinese were killed in the incident—including at least four police officers and a police chief—and around 50 others injured.In late November, Chinese official media reported that police killed 28 members of a “terrorist group” following a two-month manhunt for suspects in the coal mine attack. Local sources said the suspects, who included women and children, were members of five or six ethnic Uyghur families who lived in the area.A report last week by China’s official CCTV said the attack was masterminded by two men, Musa Toxtiniyaz and Memet Eysa, who had been influenced by extremist videos, and included a prison confession by Turghun Emet—an alleged attacker who surrendered—who said they had given him a knife and told him he would go to paradise if he killed someone.Emet said he had initially hidden with the other suspects in a cave following the attack, but later left for the home of his father-in-law, who CCTV said had convinced the young man to surrender to police.Additionally, CCTV reported that four ethnic Uyghur herders who had been guiding police through the mountainous region were taken hostage by the suspects during the manhunt and that Memet Toxtiniyaz, a Uyghur police chief from Bay county, was later kidnapped while searching for them.It said Toxtiniyaz had “bravely negotiated the release” of the four hostages, but that he was later “martyred” by the suspects.Testimonies ‘fake’A teacher in Bay county, who spoke to RFA’s Uyghur Service on condition of anonymity, said the reports were inaccurate and had been manufactured by the authorities to support their version of events and justify their killing of the suspects.“The government is propagating the success of the operation in such a ridiculous way—how can we believe that Memet Toxtiniyaz rescued the four hostages when he couldn’t even rescue himself,” the teacher asked.“The suspects kidnapped the four herders simply to avoid being found by the police … It is clear that the suspects did not intend to kill them, because otherwise they could have done so on the day they were taken, without waiting for Memet Toxtiniyaz and his negotiations.”The teacher said the suspects knew the herders had been coerced to help police with the manhunt and would never have thought to hurt them.“All this praise of Memet Toxtiniyaz’s braveness is unbelievable, and the testimonies supporting it made by Mahmut [one of the four herders] and Turghun Emet were fake,” he said.“It is clear that the statement was written by a reporter in Chinese, then translated [into Uyghur] for them to read, because … the adjectives used in the sentences are not words Uyghurs would ever use to praise braveness.”‘Typically brainwashed Uyghur’
