British Prime Minister David Cameron says it is very probable that the passenger plane was brought down by a bomb. US President Barack Obama has also stated that Washington is taking the possibility very seriously. Egypt and Russia, however, have criticized London and Washington over the claims which are made before an investigation is finished into the incident. Cairo and Moscow say they are wondering how the western countries have arrived at the conclusion while an inquiry is still underway. Washington and London stand accused of promoting the speculation of a terrorist attack on the Russian airliner in an attempt to blame the tragedy on the Kremlin. Following the crash, a group affiliated to the ISIL terrorist group in Egypt said it downed the plane in retaliation for Moscow’s airstrikes in Syria.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to find and punish those behind last month\'s plane crash which killed over 200 people in Egypt. Moscow has confirmed that the incident was caused by a terrorist attack.

Putin also pledged to intensify anti-terrorist airstrikes in Syria. The Russian Federal Security Service says that traces of explosives have been found in the wreckage of the plane, which disintegrated in midair. Moscow has offered a 50-million dollar reward for any information that will result in finding the suspects. Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have arrested two airport employees in connection with the crash. Officials say 17 people have been held, but that these two are the prime suspects. On October 31, the Russian airliner crashed in Egypt\'s Sinai Peninsula shortly after take-off. It was the deadliest aviation disaster in Russia’s history.
