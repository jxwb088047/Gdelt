The New York Times has a story about what is happening in the fight against the PKK in Turkey. The Turkish government doesn’t allow much press into the area, and frame it as a fight against terrorists. They’ve now rolled in tanks which have fired into cities. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Gunfire clattered constantly and smoke rose from two towns in south-east Turkey as the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Kurdish militants would be “annihilated” in an intensifying urban battle that has killed 25 fighters in two days.

The three-decades-old insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party flared up again in July after the collapse of a ceasefire that had lasted two years, plunging Turkey’s mainly Kurdish south-east back into open conflict.

Twenty-four PKK militants were killed in Cizre and one in Silopi in the latest operations, the Turkish military said in a statement. Eight members of the security forces suffered wounds that were not life threatening.

The two towns, in Şırnak province near the border with Syria and Iraq, have become central targets for the latest anti-PKK operations in which Turkey’s media says 10,000 police and troops, backed by tanks, are taking part.”*

Why did Turkey shoot down a Russian jet? Was it because Russia violated their air space? Well that can’t be the case; I already explained how you couldn’t have done this in a 17 sec window in my other video. And now Russia shows us that they never even crossed the border, meaning turkey not only had to plan this but, cross into Syrian air space to drop the jet. So why did they do it?

On January 6, a 14-year-old Kurdish boy named Ümit Kurt was shot dead by Turkish special forces in the Syrian border town of Cizre in southeast Turkey.

Ümit Kurt was killed as he walked home through an area controlled by the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement (YDG-H), the militant youth wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK). The YDG-H has been acting as a paramilitary force in Cizre for the past few months and has closed off several Kurdish neighborhoods with their armed checkpoints and patrols.

VICE News gained exclusive access to members of the YDG-H, mostly in their teens and early twenties, who give their story on why gun battles broke out between them and the Turkish security forces, leading to some of the worst fighting in Cizre since the 1990s.

On January 6, a 14-year-old Kurdish boy named Ümit Kurt was shot dead by Turkish special forces in the Syrian border town of Cizre in southeast Turkey.

Ümit Kurt was killed as he walked home through an area controlled by the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement (YDG-H), the militant youth wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK). The YDG-H has been acting as a paramilitary force in Cizre for the past few months and has closed off several Kurdish neighborhoods with their armed checkpoints and patrols.

VICE News gained exclusive access to members of the YDG-H, mostly in their teens and early twenties, who give their story on why gun battles broke out between them and the Turkish security forces, leading to some of the worst fighting in Cizre since the 1990s.

The Syrian uprising is an ongoing, violent internal conflict in Syria. It is part of the wider Arab Spring, a wave of upheaval throughout the Arab world. Public demonstrations across Syria began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba’ath Party rule.
Since spring 2011, the Syrian government has deployed the Syrian Army to quell the uprising. Several cities have been besieged, but nevertheless the unrest continues. According to witnesses, soldiers who refused to open fire on civilians were summarily executed by the Syrian Army. The Syrian government denied reports of defections, and blamed "armed gangs" for causing trouble. Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an insurgency campaign against the Syrian Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the Free Syrian Army and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacks an organized leadership.
