Iran has long loved it’s “Death to America” slogan. The Supreme Leader is now trying to improve the relations with the West, and wants to explain the nuance behind the controversial catchphrase. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"“The slogan ‘death to America’ is backed by reason and wisdom,” the 76-year-old ayatollah said in remarks published on his website on Tuesday.

But Khamenei, who has faced criticism from hardliners at home over the landmark nuclear agreement with the US, also attempted to draw a line between the American people and their administration.

“It goes without saying that the slogan does not mean death to the American nation; this slogan means death to the US’s policies, death to arrogance,” he said.”*

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met in Tehran on Saturday, pledging to beef up practical cooperation between the two countries and jointly safeguard security, peace and stability in the region and around the world.

Noting that China and Iran enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges, Xi said China will always be a \"reliable cooperative partner\" of Iran and stands ready to deepen bilateral cooperation on all fronts.

China and Iran are \"natural partners\" in implementing the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, the president said, calling on the two sides to boost cooperation in infrastructure, interconnectivity, production capacity and energy within the framework of the initiative for the benefit of the two peoples.

Xi told Khamenei that China will unswervingly follow a peaceful development path and adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace.

Khamenei expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Iran, and said Tehran is willing to push the bilateral practical cooperation to a new high.

Iran is an important country along the Belt and Road and stands ready to play a greater role in jointly pursuing the initiative with China, the supreme leader said.

He said China is a very influential country in the world and Iran hopes to strengthen communication and coordination with China to jointly safeguard security, peace and stability in the region.

Xi concluded on Saturday night his five-day, three-nation tour in the Middle East, which had previously taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. More on: http://newscont...

Iran\'s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has successfully undergone prostate surgery, according to official media.

The 75-year-old was visited at a government hospital in Tehran by President Rohani.

Khamenei said beforehand that there was no need to worry - but that did not mean he did not need people\'s prayers.

Doctors say the surgery was \"routine\".

With Congress set to vote on the Iranian nuclear deal next week, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei tweeted a death threat to Israel. 

Firstly, you will not see next 25 years; God willing, there will be nothing as Zionist regime by next 25 years. Secondly, until then, struggling, heroic and jihadi morale will leave no moment of serenity for Zionists.

This is the same man who back in March, led chants of “Death to America.”


Crowd: Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! 

Khamenei: Death to America, of course, because America is the principal element behind this pressure. 


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the threat on his Facebook page. 

Netanyahu in Hebrew: Khamenei is not giving supporters of the agreement any room for illusion. 

He has made it clear that the US is the Great Satan and that Iran intends to destroy the State of Israel. 

This will not happen.

 Israel is a strong country and it will become even stronger.

 However, the conclusion that arises from the remarks of the tyrant in Tehran is that all responsible countries must cooperate in order to stop Iran’s terrorism and aggression which, to my regret, will only increase as a result of the agreement.

The deadline for the final congressional vote is September 17 and President Obama has vowed to veto any resolution brought to his desk. Senate Democrats have enough support for the Iran deal that they could prevent an override to Obama’s veto. 

With this deal looming, do you stand with Israel? Share and comment below....

Grand AyatollahSayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (Persian: سید علی حسینی خامنه ای‎, Azerbaijani: سید علی حسینی خامنه‌ای – Seyyid Əli Xameneyi, pronounced [ʔæˈliː hoseiˈniː xɒːmeneˈʔiː] ( listen); born 17 July 1939) is the Supreme Leader of Iran, and a Twelver Shi'a marja. He had also served as the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2010, Forbes selected him 26th in the list of 'World's Most Powerful People'.
Holding absolute power in his country, he has been described as one of only three people having "important influence" during the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran . Khamenei was the victim of an attempted assassination in June 1981 that paralyzed his right arm, although so far the biggest challenge to his leadership has been the mass protests following the June 2009 presidential elections during which he strongly supported president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They have had a falling out since.
Khamenei holds the title of Sayyed, which means that he claims direct patrilineal descent from Ali ibn Abi Talib. Some[which?] of Khamenei's ancestors are from Tafresh in today's Markazi province, and had migrated from their original home in Tafresh to Tabriz. Born in Mashhad, he is second eldest of eight children, and two of his brothers are also clerics. His younger brother, Hadi Khamenei, is a renowned newspaper editor and cleric. Khamenei is Iranian Azeri on his father's side and his mother is a Yazd-native Persian.
