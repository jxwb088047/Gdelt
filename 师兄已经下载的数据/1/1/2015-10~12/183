An employee who was in the building where the San Bernardino shooting took place Wednesday shared a video from the scene with KPCC.

Gabi Flores gave KPCC permission to post the video taken inside the Inland Regional Center, where she works as a customer services coordinator. 

In the video, you can see an officer leading the group to safety. At one point, he says: \"Try to relax, try to relax. I\'ll take a bullet before you do, that\'s for damn sure.\"

San Bernardino Police confirmed that at least 14 people are dead and 14 people have been injured in the mass shooting. Police say there were up to three suspects who may have left the area in a dark-colored SUV. They are still at large. 

“They came prepared to do what they did as if they were on a mission,\" said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan in a press conference Wednesday.

On the scene live at the worst shooting massacre i\'ve ever witnessed out here in my home town of San Bernardino California where I have lived my whole life. Sadly 3 gunmen went to the San Bernardino regional office and killed 14 people and injuring 17 and ran away, a little later the SUV was found and the police shot and killed 2 and one was detained. The POS they said was responsibles name is \"Syed Farook\" an ex San Bernardino county employee. My love and thoughts go out to all the victims of my hometown San Bernardino, CA.

Today a social services center in San Bernardino, CA was the target of up to three terrorists. Witnesses said one to three armor-clad, armed individuals were involved.

Investigation of the San Bernardino false flag, operation gladio / northwoods shooting, using only details that slipped through the mainstream propaganda \"news\" channels, dispatch recordings, eyewitness accounts or footage, and basic common sense! 

RIP to the victims and please accept my apology if this offends or upsets anyone in any way.

If you were hellbent on going to hell and you wanted to use a tragedy to gain political leverage, by any means necessary. You wouldn\'t shoot up a brothel or a drug house with poor souls, sadly no one would care. No, you\'d target a childrens school, a family movie theater or a centre where good people help the disabled!


Very interesting documents I came across recently, that unequivocally prove terrorism and the unjust killing of anyone has absolutely no place in Islam:
https://covenantsoftheprophet.wordpress.com/2013/08/11/the-covenant-of-the-prophet-muhammad-with-the-christians-of-the-world-1630/

The awakening against and raising awareness of satanic forces, should never cease. Knowing is half the battle. All humans are one family and we have a common enemy. In my honest opinion I think he\'s soon going to play the big moves he\'s been planning for a long long time now.

This isn\'t fear mongering, because the only One we should fear is the Almighty who has power over all things.
