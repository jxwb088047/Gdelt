Hillary Ad: GOP has admitted Benghazi Investigation Bogus | Informed Comment
Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola | (The Young Turks) | – –
“Hillary Clinton responded to Kevin McCarthy’s recent gaffe admitting the political motivations for the Benghazi committees.
Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. . .
“Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has leveraged House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA) recent comments about the Select Committee on Benghazi into a television ad attacking Republicans.
A 30-second ad released by the campaign on Monday night begins by saying, “The Republicans finally admit it.”
The ad then includes a clip of McCarthy’s recent comments about the political success of the Benghazi committee…
The Clinton ad then notes, “Republican have spent millions attacking Hillary because she’s fighting for everything they oppose.”

“Benghazi” and “email” are media dog whistles relating to Candidate Clinton. And much ado about NOTHING.
Just like “Muslim” is the dog whistle for our President and “Socialist” is the equivalent for Senator Sanders.
Why is it right-wing candidates don’t receive their own media dog whistles?
Because pointing out that they’re rabidly paranoid and violent neo-fascists is not good for the advertising revenues.
Thank you to all of my supporters for your generosity and your encouragement of an independent press! Checks to
