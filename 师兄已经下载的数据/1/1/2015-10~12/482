China bombings suspect died in blast, police say - CelebCafe.org
A suspect believed to be responsible for a series of bombings in China this week that killed 10 people and injured 51 was himself killed at the scene, the official Xinhua news agency said on its microblog today, citing regional police officials.
China News Service reported Cai Tianlai, a senior police officer, as saying that a total of 60 suspicious parcels had been identified through tipoffs from local people.
Wei assembled homemade timing bombs and disguised them as packages, the police statement said. It did not provide details. Seven people were killed when 17 bombs went off in Liuzhou on Wednesday. Wei reportedly hired vendors to deliver parcel bombs which exploded when opened.
Though a few raised the possibility of Uighur involvement in the attacks, authorities have ruled out terrorism.
It also said that 10 people died, rather than the seven previously reported.
“Modern Chinese society has lots of contradictions, and if people want to send a message about their anger or make a point, they can get explosives from any mine”, said Pan Zhiping, a domestic security expert at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences.
China has shut down for a week to celebrate the National Day since yesterday.
According to a police circular, Wei lives in the Dapu Township and is a former employee of a quarry in Liucheng.
The explosions Wednesday afternoon hit a hospital, markets, a shopping mall, a bus station and several government buildings.
Actually, Ren said he was buying the explosives and keeping them with no issues at home for the past decade, though he appeared to don’t have any violent intent.
In September last year, a court in south-western China’s Yunnan province jailed a man for three years after finding more than 20 kg of explosives at his house.
