Doctors Without Borders Details US Army's Hospital Massacre
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 9, 2015Leave a Comment
Doctors Without Borders has released a new report detailing the hospital bombing in Kunduz, Afghanistan. It describes the brutal details of patients burning in their beds, staff decapitated in the blasts, and doctors being gunned down in the streets from arial AC-130 fire as they tried to flee the massacre. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), and Mark Thompson, hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“But the medical group’s leaders maintain that was not a reason to bomb a fully functioning hospital with 105 patients and surgeries ongoing, the only one of its kind in northern Afghanistan.
“Wounded combatants are patients under international law, and must be free from attack and treated without discrimination,” said Christopher Stokes, the group’s general director. “Medical staff should never be punished or attacked for providing treatment to wounded combatants.”
An internal review by Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials, MSF, concluded that staff members were in full control of the hospital, that there were no armed combatants within the compound and no fighting in or near the trauma center before the airstrikes.”*
