The election of Jeremy Corbyn to be the head of UK’s labour party is paying off at the very least for the party itself. Their membership rolls have soared to historical highs. His success in terms of being able to implement changes is still to be determined. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"To put it very simply: Corbyn\'s policy views are way out to the left of the Labour mainstream. Not all of his ideas are extreme, but enough of them are that the party chiefs fear they\'re unelectable now that he\'s going to lead the party.

The BBC has an excellent rundown of Corbyn\'s actual policy platform. It includes, among other things, renationalizing Britain\'s railroad system and energy companies, abolishing tuition for British universities, and imposing rent controls to deal with Britain\'s affordable housing problem. He\'s even open to reopening the coal mines that used to be a big part of Britain\'s economy. It\'s essentially a throwback to the unreconstructed socialism — the real thing, way beyond Bernie Sanders — of the old-school British Labour Party, which used to be way more into the idea of the government controlling huge sectors of the economy.”*

Democracynow.org - Longtime British socialist MP Jeremy Corbyn has just been elected leader of the opposition Labor Party after running on an antiwar, anti-austerity platform. When Corbyn first announced his candidacy three months ago, oddsmakers put his odds of winning at 200 to one. But on Saturday, Corbyn won in a landslide, receiving 59 percent of the vote. He will succeed Ed Miliband, who quit after the Conservatives retained power in May’s election. Corbyn addressed supporters at a victory celebration on Saturday. \"Let us be a force for change in the world, a force for humanity in the world, a force for peace in the world, and a force that recognizes we cannot go on like this, with grotesque levels of global insecurity, grotesque threats to our environment all around the world, without the rich and powerful governments stepping up to the plate to make sure our world becomes safer and better,\" said Corbyn during his victory speech. Corbyn then left the celebration to attend the #RefugeesWelcome rally in London.

Democracynow.org - Jeremy Corbyn has been a member of the House of Commons since 1983 and has a long history of voting against his Labor Party, which had moved considerably to the right under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Corbyn’s victory presages the prospect of a return to the party’s socialist roots, championing the renationalization of public transportation, free university tuition, rent control, and a national maximum wage to cap the salaries of high earners. We speak to longtime British editor and writer Tariq Ali, who has known Corbyn for 40 years. He calls Corbyn the most left-wing leader in the history of the British Labor Party.

Mr Jeremy Corbyn has been elected as the New leader of the labour party in The UK and aims to move the country decidedly to the \'left\' of politics.

In his victory speech he said: “During these amazing three months, our party has changed. We have grown enormously, because of the hopes of so many ordinary people for a different Britain, a better Britain, a more equal Britain, a more decent Britain. They are fed up with the inequality, the injustice, the unnecessary poverty. 
All those issues have brought people in, in a spirit of hope and optimism.\"

The Conservative Party led by Prime Minister David Cameron said that Mr Corbyn’s appointment “ posed a threat to our economy and national security”.

Under his leadership, there is little doubt that the Labour Party is now set for a radical shift to the left. During his campaign Mr Corbyn called for an anti-austerity programme, an anti-war programme, end to benefit cuts, higher taxes on the rich, renationalisation of the railways and energy sector, rent controls, an end to zero-hour contracts, the abolition of student tuition fees and the scrapping of the Trident Nuclear deterrent.

The Prime Minister made the most of the anniversary year of the Bard\'s death to needle the Labour leader David Cameron poked fun at Jeremy Corbyn\'s epic reshuffle today, with a string of Shakespeare themed jokes.

He took the opportunity of the 400th anniversary of bard\'s death this April to have a pop at the Labour leader\'s shambolic and lengthy front-bench shake-up.

He told the House: \"I think it is a very good moment, the 400th anniversary of the death of Shakespeare, for us to celebrate everything that he has given to our language and to our culture and indeed to the world.

Jeremy Bernard Corbyn (born 26 May 1949) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North since 1983.
He attended Adams' Grammar School in Shropshire. He is the younger brother of Piers Corbyn, a global warming sceptic.
He currently lives in Finsbury Park and has three sons. Previously Corbyn lived in Lausanne Road in Harringay where he was active in securing the future of a small local park created from a World War II bomb site.
He is considered one of the most left-wing of Labour Party MPs and is member of the Socialist Campaign Group. He has a weekly column in The Morning Star. A long-time supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), he is one of its three Vice-Chairs. Before his election to Parliament, he was an elected councillor in the London Borough of Haringey (1974–83). He is on the London Regional Select Committee.
He was fiercely opposed to the Iraq War and has spoken at many anti-war rallies in Britain and overseas. He is an elected member of the Stop the War Coalition steering committee. On 31 October 2006, Corbyn was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party's call for an inquiry into the war.
