Instead of dislike, Facebook is testing \'Reactions\' animated emoji

Facebook has begun testing out \'emoji reactions.\' And USA Today decided to celebrate by putting the emojis sitting next to articles on its front page. The experiment seemed to have backfired. How can you explain a crying emoji next to a story about a stabbing? David Callaway, the editor-in-chief of USA Today, said, “Social media and its icons are becoming a dominant form of communication in our world. We wanted to show what they would be like if transferred to print.”Facebook has just unveiled some the dislike button! After years of pestering from Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg finally relented and didn\'t actually give us a dislike button. What he\'s instead given us is several emoji\'s depicting different emotions in relation to specific posts. Might be useful I guess. I am very close to caring, at least.

MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA — Facebook has announced the launch of \"Reactions,\" an extension of its \"Like\" button, on Feb. 24. 

For years, users have been asking for a \"dislike\" button in contrast, and Facebook has now answered with five new additional buttons: \"love,\" \"haha,\" \"wow,\" \"sad\" and \"angry.\"

The new buttons, plus the existing \"Like\" button are collectively called \"Reactions\" and can be utilized by hovering over the old \"Like\" icon on a computer or holding down on the icon on the mobile app. 

The project began over a year ago, after Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg finally conceded that the platform needed a better way for users to interact with posts and that not every post is likeable.

With so many different emoticons available, Facebook developers decided to focus on a subset that users expressed most often. They looked at the most frequently used stickers, emojis and one-word comments, and found a few common emotional threads.

The team narrowed it down and tested a batch on users from around the world, ultimately landing on the final five additions.

Facebook updates haven\'t always been well-received.

\"We understand that this is a big change, and want to be thoughtful about rolling this out,\" wrote product manager Sammi Krug in a blog post. \"We have been testing Reactions in a few markets since last year, and have received positive feedback so far. Today, we\'re excited to offer it to everyone who uses Facebook around the world. We will continue learning and listening to feedback to make sure we have a set of reactions that will be useful for everyone.\"

Facebook Reactions Emoji Expand the Like Button...
Facebook started testing their new dislike button what they are calling \"Reactions,\" which are essentially emojis that users can use to express emotions beyond just \"like.\"

So instead of just getting one, giant thumbs down button to use on statuses we certainly do not like (because who wants to press \"like\" when someone announces they are divorcing a cheating spouse?), Facebook users will get to choose from six different emojis, as well as the like button.

The emojis people can use to react to statues are \"love,\" \"haha,\" \"yay,\" \"wow,\" \"sad\" and \"angry.\" These emojis also move, almost like a GIF.

A like button, like option or recommend button is a feature in communication software such as social networking services, Internet forums, news websites and blogs where the user can express that he/she likes, enjoys or supports certain content. Internet services that feature like buttons usually display the quantity of users who liked each content, and may show a full or partial list of them. This is a quantitative alternative to other methods of expressing reaction to content, like writing a reply text.
Some websites also include a dislike button, so the user can either vote in favour, against or neutrally. Other websites include more complex Web content voting systems, for example five stars.
Like buttons as used by social networks on websites other than their own are often used as web bugs to track user activities for targeted advertising such as behavioral targeting combined with personally identifiable information (PII) and may be considered a breach of browser security and internet safety privacy concerns.
