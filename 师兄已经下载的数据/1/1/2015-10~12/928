URUMQI, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Thursday said that long-term stability and security is the top priority in Xinjiang, stressing counterterrorism as the focus of the current work.
Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks at a grand rally in Urumqi, the regional capital, marking the 60th anniversary of the autonomous region's founding.
All policies and programs on economic development, people's livelihoods, reform, ethnic minorities and religion should contribute to the final goal, Yu said.
"We must be fully aware of the severe situation we are facing to maintain long-term stability in Xinjiang," Yu said. "Counterterrorism is the focus of our current work."
The government will also address other social problems, he said, adding that it will balance security efforts with the need for economic development, he promised.
Yu noted prominent development of Xinjiang over the past 60 years in various fields such as agriculture, farming, modern industry, logistics, tourism, infrastructure, transport, and environmental protection. He cited that the region's GDP last year was 115.6 times of that in 1955.
"The living standards for people of all ethnic groups have improved considerably... [The region] has achieved the shift from poverty to a well-off society in general, and is striding forward to an all-round well-off society," Yu said, citing the nine-year compulsory education which has covered urban and rural areas, better medical services, and the protection of culture and custom of ethnic minorities.
According to Yu, various favorable policies carried out by the Communist Party of China (CPC) have led to a noted increase in the number of officials and professionals of ethnic minorities in the region.
Figures released last month by the State Council, China's cabinet, showed that, in 1955, the number of ethnic minority officials in Xinjiang was 46,000, and the figure rose to 417,000 in 2014, which accounted for 51.4 percent of total officials in the region.
More will be done to raise morale and unite the people of Xinjiang so that they stand firmly shoulder-to-shoulder with the Party and government to build an "iron wall" that safeguards stability and security, he said.
BEIJING, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Wednesday highlighted the role of the Chinese military in Xinjiang stability, saying troops should play a bigger role in fighting separatism, terrorism and extremism.
