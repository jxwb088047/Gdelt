Take a closer look at the two routes in our full coverage of the Belt and Road initiative.  First stop, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the country's westernmost administrative provincial region. It is a core zone for the Belt and Road initiative, as the "Belt" goes beyond the border from here.  
Earlier we spoke to Xinjiang native, a TV correspondent working in Xinjiang. He told us about Xinjiang's geographic advantage and the rapid development he's seen there.
Xinjiang locates at the northwest of China, neighboring 8 countries of Russia and Mongolia in the north, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the west, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan and India in the Southwest. So we could say that Xinjiang is the bridge linking inland China and the Mid-Asian countries, as far as Europe.
Xinjiang has rich resources, the shortest transportation distance to the west with the lowest cost, experience of its neighbors' market demand, and barrier free communication with these countries.
Xinjiang has made the 5 centers construction plan to cope with the Road and Belt Initiative. It covers the functions of industry and manufacturing, business and trade, resource exploration, culture and education, finance and baking, transportation and logistics, as well as medical services.
So Xinjiang is going all out to get ready for the great development period, and welcomes investment and construction from home and abroad."
