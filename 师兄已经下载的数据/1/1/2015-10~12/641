London Knife Terrorist Kills Zero, Injures Three - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiDecember 7, 2015Leave a Comment
Another terrorist attack, this time in the UK. It was one guy, who was screaming, “this is for Syria.” He was apparently a muslim radical who was trying to kill civilians. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Tube station ‘machete’ attack sees two injured as reports say a man was Tasered after slashing someone’s throat, police are treating it as a terrorist incident.
David Pethers, 33, was cut as he tried to approach the “crazy” assailant who had just stabbed another man and left him in a pool of blood.
But the lift engineer still tried to disarm the man before police arrived and Tasered him.
Security was stepped up at Tube and train stations with extra officers on patrol following Britain’s first terror attack since the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013.
Police are examining whether the suspect, a 29-year-old man, may have a history of mental health problems.
He stormed into Leytonstone Tube Station around 7pm on Saturday and began attacking travellers as he screamed “this is for Syria”.”*
