Naked Burglar Crawls Into Armed Man’s Bed
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiOctober 25, 2015Leave a Comment
A man broke into a house, took of his clothes, climbed into a couples bed while they were sleeping, and kissed a man. Though the burglar was armed with a knife, the man fought back, grabbed his gun, and fired at the intruder while he fled. The home invader has been arrested. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show), Lissette Padilla, and Kelly Carlin hosts of The Young Turks discuss.
Is this a case where gun ownership makes sense? Would you have shot at the intruder? Let us know in the comments below.
“An Oregon man was arrested Thursday after he broke into a Portland home, stripped naked, crawled into bed with the couple who live there and kissed the man — who turned out to have a gun — police said.

Richard Dean Defeudis, 32, was held on $310,000 bail in the Multnomah County Jail pending arraignment Friday on charges of first- and second-degree burglary, first-degree sex abuse and unlawful use of a weapon.
An incident report says Defeudis broke into the home about 3:40 a.m. (6:40 a.m. ET) Thursday and began gathering items of value.”
