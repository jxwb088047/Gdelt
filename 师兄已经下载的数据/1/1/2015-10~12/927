An elderly woman in Wisconsin who was a little concerned about her neighbor. The woman called the police and asked them to check in on her “noisy, naughty neighbors.” The woman claimed her neighbor was screaming support for ISIS during sex. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks breaks it down.
“A nosy neighbor in the village of Brown Deer, Wisconsin reported her neighbors to the local police on suspicion of terrorist activities. Her evidence? That they were exclaiming the wonders of the Islamic State during coitus.
WDJT reports the 82-year-old woman called Brown Deer police and asked them to check in on her noisy, naughty neighbors. According to the report, the caller claimed she could hear one of the two lovebirds saying “ISIS is good, ISIS is great” during the act.
The local news item quickly exploded on Twitter. At one point, Brown Deer Police Chief Michael Kass joked that maybe the caller had taken “see something say something a little too far.”*
