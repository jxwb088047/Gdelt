For the most part, when I've written about Donald Trump (R-Wherever), it's been more in a general sense of his impact on the Republican campaign, not any specifics.

CAIR Asks Donald Trump to Apologize to Muslim Woman Abused by Crowd, Kicked Out of Rally

(WASHINGTON, D.C., 1/8/16) - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to offer a public apology to a Muslim woman verbally abused by the crowd and kicked out of one of his campaign rallies tonight in South Carolina.

“The image of a Muslim woman being abused and ejected from a political rally sends a chilling message to American Muslims and to all those who value our nation’s traditions of religious diversity and civic participation,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. “Donald Trump should issue a public apology to the Muslim woman kicked out of his rally and make a clear statement that American Muslims are welcome as fellow citizens and as participants in the nation’s political process.”

Awad also called on Trump to meet with American Muslim leaders to help stem the anti-Muslim hysteria resulting from his rhetoric and that of other GOP presidential candidates.

Last month, CAIR joined other national American Muslim organizations in condemning a Trump policy statement “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Donald Trump is doubling down on his proposed policy of registering all muslims nationwide. He doesn’t seem worried about the concerns of some media and other politicians that this sounds eerily similar to Nazi rhetoric. Ana Kasparian (The Point), John Iadarola (Think Tank), and Jimmy Dore (The Jimmy Dore Show Podcast), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Donald J. Trump drew back Friday from calling for a national database to keep track of Muslims in America, saying that the suggestion had come from a reporter.

Mr. Trump caused a stir Thursday night when he was asked by an NBC reporter if all Muslims should have to register with the federal government and replied: “They have to be.”

When pressed on how such a database would work, he said that people would have to sign up in different places and that it would be an issue of management.

On Friday, he took to Twitter to distance himself from the idea.

Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty.
