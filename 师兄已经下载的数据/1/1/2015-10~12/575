Belarus ready to boost cooperation with China's northwest regions: minister - China.org.cn
Belarusian Economy Minister
Vladimir Zinovsky said Wednesday that Belarus is ready to develop
cooperation with China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in all fields.
Belarus is eager to boost ties with
the two Chinese regions in such fields as trade, economy, culture,
education, logistics, agriculture, and in the implementation of the
"Belt and Road" initiative, he said here at a bilateral forum on
trade and economic cooperation.
It is very important for Minsk to
step up cooperation with Xinjiang, as China's Silk Road Economic
Belt crosses the territory of Belarus and Xinjiang, he said.
Deputy governor of Xinjiang, Shi
Dagang, said economic development zones of Xinjiang are interested
in cooperation with the Chinese-Belarusian Industrial Park that is
under construction in Belarus.
Xinjiang also pays huge attention
to agricultural cooperation with Belarus, especially in
agricultural machine building, he added.
The bilateral forum brought
together more than 250 businessmen from Belarus and China's
Xinjiang and Ningxia. Endit
