Exclusive footage from inside ISIS-controlled city Raqqa. Filmed by two brave women for Expressen. \"We want the world to know,\" they say: http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/womens-secret-films-from-within-closed-city-of-islamic-state/?cmpid=youtube

Using hidden cameras two brave Syrian women show us what life is like inside al-Raqqah, capital city of terrorist sect ISIS in northern Syria. They know they will be stoned to death if they are exposed. They are willing to risk their lives to help the rest of the world understand.

FACTS ABOUT THE WAR IN SYRIA AND ISIS:
- The war in Syria has entered its sixth year. In March of 2011 Syrians protested in Daraa in south Syria and demanded the release of arrested boys who had scribbled slogans against the regime. The protests spread rapidly to other areas i Syria.

- Several parties are involved. The Muslim Brotherhood, Libanese Hizbollah and al-Qaida are some of several hundreds of militias who fight in Syria.

- Today it\'s mostly al-Nusra, Jaish al-Islam and ISIS who have control in the rebel-controlled areas. They get support from regional powers, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The regime gets support from Hizbollah, Iran and Russia.

- About six million Syrian children are affected by the war and live in the danger zone for violence, according to the UN. The countries healthcare has collapsed and the population is in deep poverty. The tragedy in Syria has developed into the world\'s largest humanitary catastrophy.

In the few short years since the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria formed, it has done the seemingly impossible, seizing vast areas of the Middle East to form a mini-state it calls a reincarnation of the ancient Caliphate. It is at war with all its neighbors and virtually the entire world, yet someone remains, and is launching increasingly deadly terror attacks abroad.

To understand how this terrible group came about and how it has grown so powerful, you need to understand the story behind its rise. And that is a story that goes back decades, to long before ISIS existed

This is the new face of evil. This is what nightmares are made of.
Ruthless cold blooded killers on a mission to wage war. To annihilate
millions of people. We are their enemy and they will stop at nothing
to destroy us. All measures must be taken in our defense that always
will we remember the character of the onslaught against us. 

Once again, the growth of ISIS can be traced directly back to our government’s
insane policy of aiding terrorists who went on to join ISIS after the destabilization
of the secular governments of Libya and Syria.

RAQQA — An ISIS boss who taught jihadis how to decapitate people got his just desserts when he lost his own head to a British SAS sniper\'s rifle.

The marksman with the British Army\'s Special Air Service Regiment shot the ISIS executioner in the back of the head as he showed recruits at a training camp in northern Syria how to decapitate prisoners, according to the Daily Star Sunday.

The sniper was one of 20 SAS soldiers who sneaked into a terrorist-held area two weeks ago, an unnamed British military source told the Daily Star Sunday.

Intelligence reported that the area could not be bombed in an air strike because it was in a small village, close to a school, and the risk of collateral damage was too high.

The sniper got into position and waited almost 12 hours. The target: a jihadi training camp 1,200 meters away.

The SAS team waited until the ISIS commander began showing recruits how to cut prisoners\' heads off, according to the Daily Star Sunday.

The sniper got the all-clear to fire as the ISIS chief demonstrated cutting motions with knives, axes and a sword.

Using a high-powered Dan .338 rifle and aiming more than a foot off to allow for the wind, the marksman took out the ISIS boss with one shot, the Daily Star Sunday reported, citing the military source.

The commander was reportedly easy to spot because he wore white robes, which is unusual for ISIS fighters.

Most of the 20 ISIS recruits deserted the camp following the SAS operation, according to the military source quoted by the Daily Star Sunday.

The Middle Ages (adjectival form: medieval, mediaeval or mediæval) is a period of European history encompassing the 5th to the 15th centuries. It is normally marked from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, accepted as the end of Classical Antiquity, until the beginning of the Renaissance and Age of Discovery, which ushered in the Modern Era. It is thus the middle period of the traditional division of Western history into Classical, Medieval, and Modern. The Middle Ages is often split into two or three sub-divisions.
In the Early Middle Ages, depopulation, deurbanization, and barbarian invasion, all of which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued apace. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the eastern empire, became an Islamic Empire after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break was not as extreme as once put forth by historians, with most of the new kingdoms incorporating as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, established an empire covering much of western Europe; it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders – the Vikings, Magyars, and Saracens.
