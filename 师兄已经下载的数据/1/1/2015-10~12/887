Introduction
The Uyghurs are the native people of East Turkestan, also known as Sinkiang or Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The latest Chinese census gives the present population of the Uyghurs estimate according to Chinese official statement 8,345,622 million. But the Uyghurs estimate themselves more than 20 millions. There are also 500,000 Uyghurs in West Turkestan mostly known as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan . Almost 75,000 Uyghurs have their homes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Europe and the United States.

The Chinese sources indicate that the Uyghurs are the direct descendants of the Huns.

Ancient Greek, Iranian, and Chinese sources placed Uyghurs with their tribes, and sub-tribes in the vast area between the west banks of the Yellow River in the east, Eastern Turkestan in the west, and in the Mongolian steppe in the northeast as early as 300 B.C..

Early History

Uyghur Empire
After the fall of the Kokturk Empire in Central Asia, the Uyghurs established their true state Uyghur empire in 744, with the city of Karabalgasun, on the banks of the Orkhun River, as its capital. After the death of Baga Tarkan in 789 and specially after that of his successor, Kulug Bilge Khagan in 790, Uyghur power and prestige declined.

The Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom
The Kanchou (Ganzhou) Uyghur Kingdom, which was established in today's Gansu province of China, in 850. Several thousand of these Uyghurs still live in the Kansu (Gansu) area under the name yellow Uyghurs or Yugurs, preserving their old Uyghur mother tongue and their ancient Yellow sect of Lamaist Buddhism.

The Karakhoja Uyghur Kingdom
The Uyghurs living in the northern part of Khan Tengri (Tianshan Mountains) in East Turkestan established the Karakhoja Uyghur Kingdom (Qocho) near the present day city of Turfan (Turpan), in 846. 

The Karakhanid Uyghur Kingdom
The Uyghurs living in the southern part of Khan Tengri, established the Karakhanid Uyghur Kingdom in 840 with the support of other Turkic clans like the Karluks, Turgish and the Basmils, with Kashgar as its capital. In 934, during the rule of Satuk Bughra Khan, the Karakhanids embraced Islam 19 . Thus, in the territory of East Turkestan two Uyghur kingdoms were set up: the Karakhanid, who were Muslims, and the Karakhojas, who were Buddhists.In 1397 this Islamic and Buddhist Uyghur Kingdoms merged into one state and maintained their independence until 1759.

Manchu Invasion
The Manchus who set up a huge empire in China, invaded the Uyghur Kingdom of East Turkestan in 1759 and dominated it until 1862. In 1863, the Uyghurs were successful in expelling the Manchus from their motherland, and founded an independent kingdom in 1864. The money for the Manchu invasion was granted by the British Banks. After this invasion, East Turkestan was given the name Xinjiang which means "new territory" or "New Dominion" and it was annexed into the territory of the Manchu empire on November 18,1884.

Chinese communist rule
In 1911, the Nationalist Chinese, overthrew Manchu rule and established a republic. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs were successful in setting up an independent East Turkestan Republic. But these independent republics were overthrown by the military intervention and political intrigues of the Soviet Union. It was in fact the Soviet Union that proved deterrent to the Uyghur independence movement during this period. 

In 1949 Nationalist Chinese were defeated by the Chinese Communists. After that, Uyghurs fell under Chinese Communist rule.

Uyghur Civilization
At the end of the 19th and the first few decades of the 20th century, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region along the Silk Road in East Turkestan led to the discovery of numerous Uyghur cave temples, monastery ruins, wall paintings, statues, frescoes, valuable manuscripts, documents and books. Members of the expedition from Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, Germany, France, Japan, and the United States were amazed by the treasure they found there, and soon detailed reports captured the attention on an interested public around the world. The relics of these rich Uyghur cultural remnants brought back by Sven Hedin of Sweden, Aurel Stein of Great Britain, Gruen Wedel and Albert von Lecoq from Germany, Paul Pelliot of France, Langdon Warner of the United States, and Count Ottani from Japan can be seen in the Museums of Berlin, London, Paris, Tokyo, Leningrad and even in the Museum of Central Asian Antiquities in New Delhi. The manuscripts, documents and the books discovered in Eastern Turkestan proved that the Uyghurs had a very high degree of civilization.

This Uyghur power, prestige and civilization which dominated Central Asia for more than a thousand years went into a steep decline after the Manchu invasion of East Turkestan, and during the rule of the Nationalist and specially during the rule of the Communist Chinese.
Do you know the country named "East Turkistan"?
This area is usually called "Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region", the People's Republic of China.
This country has been invaded and is facing various suppressions by Chinese Communist Party. 

Specifically :
1) Millions of people are forced to get abortion under the name of "Family Planning".
2) More than 45 nuclear tests and radioactivities had killed a large amount of people.
3) Several tens thousands of people were slaughtered for being claimed as "political criminals". 

The East Turkistan people are still under the oppression of China.
The unique culture, language, and customs are beginning to fade by emigration of huge amount of Han people and ethnic cleansing policies. 

Unfortunately this fact is not well known worldwide. However, even now the East Turkistan people are suffering. 

Now, let's tell the world about this suffering of the East Turkistan people and protest against China!

泣き叫ぶ5歳のウイグル人少年の頭を蹴り指を折り集団で暴行を加える中国人たち

IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL TO WATCH. A 5 YEARS OLD UYGHUR BOY GOT BEATEN AND KICKED IN THE HEAD SEVERAL TIMES, THEN GOT HIS HANDS CRUSHED IN CHINA. 

There were about 30 Chinese adults including women surrounding him. But they were just watching and laughing while this little Uyghur boy was screaming and crying for help in fear of violent and death. 

Rebiya Kadeer ( a Uyghur human rights activist ) explained this Uyghur boy has a different look than other normal Uyghur boys since he looked like a caucasian. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UYGHUR ( the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China ) has 50 years history of genocide in the form of ethnic cleansing by COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC). 

Before this video taken, the Chinese government captured more than 3,000 Uyghur people and sent them to prison. There were more than 1,500 injured people. After this, the Uyghur kids and wives protested this and the Chinese government then shot at the women and children.

This is what is happening in Uyghur, Tibet and Inner Mongolia. 

Now CPC is trying to attack Japan knowing it's under unparalleled national crisis the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. 

Now is the best timing for them. China has waited for itself to seize military and political power against Japan and U.S. This is the true background of the today's dispute over Senkaku island which Japan owns. 

China has stolen the lands and resources of its neighboring countries. Uyghur has the oil and other natural resources in the region. Japan's Senkaku islands also has oil reserves under the sea.

ALONG WITH UYGHUR, TIBET INNER MONGOL, NOW JAPAN NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM CHINA. WORLD MUST STOP COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA NOW TO END ITS VIOLENCE INSIDE AND OUT OF CHINA FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN ON THIS PLANET. 

------ 09.28.2012 -------

As of Today, the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times published full-page advertisement (see photo) entitled "Diaoyu Islands (Chinese name of the Senkaku Islands) is Chinese territory". 

This is the part of strategy of Chinese Communist Party (CPC) called "FIRST ISLAND CHAIN" concept which is the Chinese military doctrine to seal off the Yellow Sea, South China Sea and East China Sea inside an arc running from the Aleutians in the north to Borneo in the south to disable American Military including bases. 

The aim of the doctrine is to dominate the west side of the Pacific Ocean, including the sea and all the Japanese, Phillipine, Malaysian islands by 2020 according to reports by American think tanks CSBA and RAND. 

As it has been seen in Tibet, Uyghur and Inner Mongolia, CPC will do anything to accomplish their missions. 

We all have to make an effort to know the truth as soon as possible, and tell that to friends, family and the world and fight against the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party to win the real peace. 

Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines and India is also fighting against CPC. Japan will never give up for them as well. 

THE WHOLE WORLD HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO PROTECT OUR PEACE IN THIS WORLD.

Pakistan and China friendship . China exporting Chinese prostitutes to Pakistan . The Pakistan government collaborates with atheist and communist China to kill their own fellow Uyghur Muslim brothers and sisters in East Turkestan.


Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarkatihu 

My beloved brothers and sisters in Pakistan . Today coincidentally I saw a video which was about Chinese prostitution center in Pakistan. After saw that video , especially I would like thanks to the journalist girl who was on that spot.
 
As you know the East Turkestan ( currently so-called Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region of China ) has been under Chinese occupation since in 1949 until now ( 2013). 

A hundred years ago the Chinese ( dynast agents ) came to East Turkestan under name of so-called international businessman and businesswoman and so on....

But step by step the Chinese dynasty thieves, prostitutes and agents potentially dominated the East Turkestan by politically and economically just as nowdays Pakistan. 

The Ignorant East Turkestan government officials didn't understand the Chinese conspiracy and they became puppet of Chinese dynast. And another aspect of the Chinese agents bought some greedy Uyghur hypocrite men and women for China's future political interest in East Turkestan and central Asia. 

Not long after some of hypocrite Uyghurs came to power of East Turkestan and began to work for sake of China. The puppet East Turkestan goverment officials day by day became very rich and the majority East Turkestan population day by day became very poor and also they had deprived of their fundamental rights.

Since in 1949 , the communist China fully control over East Turkestan and the Muslims of East Turkestan became slave of the Han chinese. 

Therefore we would like to give some advise to the Pakistani people .

The East Turkestan is still being under cotrol of communist China. But we didn't give up. We didn't lost our hope to get back our country from the filthy China , We won't lose our hope, But everything is hand of Allah . We Uyghur Muslim in East Turkestan love our beloved Pakistani brothers and sisters for sake of Allah .

As you knew , your government ( Pakistan ) collaborating the atheist and communist China against to kill your fellow Uyghur Muslims brothers and sisters in East Turkestan. Oh Pakistani people beware of Chinese conspiracy , Oh Pakistani people fear Allah. Allah is almighty , there is no barrier between Allah and oppressed people. 

Sincerely love and respect your brother from East Turkestan .
The Uyghur people are a Turkic ethnic group living in Central Asia for the most part. The vast majority of the Uyghurs live in what is today called 'Xinjiang' ( Uyghurs prefer the term 'East Turkestan'), part of the People's Republic of China. Considerable Uyghur communities also live in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan.

This video was made in China's Xinjiang province ( Uyghurs prefer the term 'East Turkestan'), and gives an impression of the traditions and remaining culture I encountered while traveling through the region. There are images of Kashgar, Hotan and smaller villages in the area.

I used a traditional Uyghur song to accompany the images.

More than three decades of nuclear testing at Lop Nor testing site in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), People‟s Republic of China (PRC), are gravely affecting the right to health of predominantly Uyghur communities in the region. It is of the utmost importance to start to address the neglected environmental and health impact of radioactive contamination for the Uyghur people, and to guarantee their right to health which is a fundamental part of every person´s human rights and the enjoyment of a dignified life. Human rights are interdependent, indivisible and interrelated. This means that violating the Uyghurs‟ right to health impairs the enjoyment of other human rights, such as the rights to adequate medical care and necessary social services, and the right to information. 

This' what communism has brought to the mankind: Death, Hunger and Oppression.














































Tags: Xinjiang (Uyghur: شىنجاڭ‎, ULY: Shinjang; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕíntɕjɑ́ŋ]; Chinese: 新疆; pinyin: Xīnjiāng), officially Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,[3] is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China in the northwest of the country. It is the largest Chinese administrative division and spans over 1.6 million km2. Xinjiang borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing region.
It is home to a number of ethnic groups including the Uyghur, Han, Kazakh, Tajiks, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Mongol, with a majority of the population adhering to Islam.[4] More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan.[5] Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.[6]
With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of peoples and empires has vied for control over all or parts of this territory. Before the 21st century, all or part of the region has been ruled or controlled by the Tocharians, Yuezhi, Xiongnu Empire, Xianbei state, Kushan Empire, Rouran Khaganate, Han Empire, Former Liang, Former Qin, Later Liang, Western Liáng, Rouran Khaganate, Tang Dynasty, Tibetan Empire, Uyghur Khaganate, Kara-Khitan Khanate, Mongol Empire, Yuan Dynasty, Chagatai Khanate, Moghulistan, Northern Yuan, Yarkent Khanate, Dzungar Khanate, Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China and, since 1950, the People's Republic of China.

East Turkestan (also Eastern Turkistan, Chinese Turkestan, and other variants) is a political term with multiple meanings depending on context and usage. Historically, the term was invented by Russian Turkologists in the 19th century to replace the term Chinese Turkestan, which referred to the Tarim Basin in the southwestern part of Xinjiang province of the Qing Dynasty. The medieval Arab toponym "Turkestan" and its derivatives were not used by the local population of the greater region, and China had its own name for an overlapping area since the Han Dynasty as Xiyu, with the parts controlled by China termed Xinjiang from the 18th century onward. The historical Uyghur name is Qurighar[citation needed] (西域; today, Qurighar Uyghur is co-used with Shinjang Uyghur by Uyghurs).
Starting in the 20th century, Uyghur separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan (or "Uyghurstan") as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang, or for a future independent state in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They reject the name of Xinjiang because of an allegedly Chinese perspective reflected in the name and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize connection to other westerly Turkic groups. However, even in nationalist writing, East Turkestan retained its older, more narrow geographical meaning. In China, the term has negative connotations because of its origins in European colonialism and present use by militant groups. The government of China actively discourages its use.
Do you know the country named "East Turkistan"?
This area is usually called "Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region", the People's Republic of China.
This country has been invaded and is facing various suppressions by Chinese Communist Party. 

Specifically :
1) Millions of people are forced to get abortion under the name of "Family Planning".
2) More than 45 nuclear tests and radioactivities had killed a large amount of people.
3) Several tens thousands of people were slaughtered for being claimed as "political criminals". 

The East Turkistan people are still under the oppression of China.
The unique culture, language, and customs are beginning to fade by emigration of huge amount of Han people and ethnic cleansing policies. 

Unfortunately this fact is not well known worldwide. However, even now the East Turkistan people are suffering. 

Now, let's tell the world about this suffering of the East Turkistan people and protest against China!

The commies in China have been harvesting organs from political prisoners from Uyghur (Uighurs) and Tibetans in Tibet and East Turkistan (Xinjiang). The commies shot a bullet in the victim's chest not killing the person, but the spot the bullet hit acts like an anesthesia knocking the victim unconscious. The commies have discovered an organ extracted from a live body has a lower incident of rejection than an organ harvested from a dead body (a cadaver). Because of this the organ brings in a premium price.

A 17 year old Uyghur male named Noor-UL-Islam Sherbaz was arrested by the commies and charged with murder. His murder trial lasted thirty minutes and he was convicted to live in a commie prison. At this 30 minute trial a video was shown of a crowd beating the victim to death; however Mr. Sherbaz was not in the video. The commies showed a second video with Mr. Sherbaz in the area however not in the crowd and nothing in his hands. The last video taken two months after the incident and after two months of being in jail, minimal food, and daily beatings, Mr. Sherbaz confessed.

On a day his mother visited him in prison he mysteriously died. Some say by lethal injection. Was he murdered for his healthy organs? The commies refused to turn his body over to this family. Hiding something?

A crowd of Uighurs protesting in front of a commie police station, all unarmed resulting in the commie police firing point blank into the crowd murdering four hundred innocent Uighurs.
-
When you have a choice and your purchase an item that is "made in China," you are then support this barbaric behavior of stealing organs from live bodies. Just picture the "made in China" you hold in your hand as being a blood soaked stolen organ from a live body, also "made in China."

Brief history of Uyghurs in Xinjiang

** Before Chinese Han Dynasty 200 BC:

Central Asia was a region predominately occupied by ancient Persian tribes such as the sedentary Sogdians ( 粟特), Chorasmians (花剌子模) and, the semi-nomadic such as Scythians (斯基泰, 西徐亞, 塞種), and Alans (奄蔡). The ancient sedentary population played an important role in the history of Central Asia. Tajiks, Pashtuns (普什图), Pamiris (塔吉克) and other Persian groups are still present in the region. The ancient Persian language (Dari) is still the official language in Afganistan and in some areas in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

Turkic group of people, such as Uyghurs, came to Central Asia very late in history (after 800 AD), much later than Han Chinese did in 200 BC.

** Chinese Han Dynasty in Xinjiang (206 BC to 220 AD): 

Han Chinese extended its power influence in the forms of territory and protectorates in today's Xinjiang, part of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Today's Xinjinag was again under the power influence (protectorates and territory) of Tang Dynasty (618-907AD) and became territory of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911AD). Peoples Republic of China has taken over the territory sovereignty over Xinjiang from Qing Dynasty and Republic of China. 

** Uyghur emigrated in Xinjiang (840-850 AD):

Uyghur Empires (742-848 AD, 回纥 or 回鶻) was in today's Mongolia with the capital at Ordu Baliq that located 300 km west of Ulaanbaatar (close to Town of Hotont) and it was annihilated by Kyrgyz tribe in 848 AD. The Kyrgyz destroyed and burned down every Uyghur cities and villages throughout the empire. Three groups of Uyghurs escaped from the annihilation. One group escaped to today's Gansu area and assimilated with Han Chinese. Another group escaped to today's Turpan in central Xinjiang. The last group escaped further west and scattered over today's Kashgar in south Xinjiang, Kyrgyzstan, Tajkistan and Uzbekistan. 

Uyghurs has never had appreciable presence in north Xinjiang. They are mostly concentrated in Kashgar, Khotan, Aksu, and Kizilsu areas in south Xinjiang and Turpan in central Xinjiang. Uyghur is about 46% of the total population in Xinjiang, Han 40% and Kazak 7%. To call Xinjiang as "UYGHUR" Autonomous Region" is highly debatable. 
 
** Xiongnu, Turkics and Turks

Turkics/Turks are Turko-Mongolian Tribes originated from today's Mongolia area. The ancesters of Uyghurs (维吾尔) is Xiongnu (匈奴). The earliest written record of Xiongnu or Turk (Tujue, 突厥) in history was in Han Dynasty around 200BC. The earliest use of the term "Uyghur" in history was in Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD). Earlier historical written records of Xiongnu, Turk or Uyghur are all done by Han Chinese because they lacked the ability of reading and writing.

The Reading and writing is an essential for any moderate sophisticated society during the evolution. Some civilization had never reached to such level of sophistication before it vanished. The transition from nomadic to sedentary is an important evolution in the early human civilization history. The four oldest human civilizations all arose on the basins of major rivers; Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, Indus and Yellow Rivers, where the fertile alluvial farm lands were easily found.

Farming, villages, cities, state-nation, different social classes, political and economic systems are the backbone of the civilization. In the process of evolution, the need for written records for economic and political affairs occurred naturally. That was why all these old civilization had evolved the writings as earlier as in 5000BC or 6000BC 

The relatively primitive nature of Turkish/Turkic culture has always influenced by the outside cultures. First the Persian influence, then Arab, and European is the most recently. 

All Turkic people have learnt how to read and write very late in human hostory. Uyghur was the first Turkic group learnt the reading and writing after they emigrated from Kyrgyz annihilation in Mongolia to today's Turpan and Tarim Basin. The writing script they used was from the ancient Persian Sogdiana script. 

Arab had huge influence on Turks/Turkics after 800 or 900 AD as Turks/Turkics have adapted Islam religion and change into the Arabic scripts in writing. 

Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey, wanted to Europeanize Turks in 1920s with the intention to get rid of Arabic influence. He wanted Turks to dress like Europeans, and write like Europeans. However, after almost 60 years of continuous efforts, Turkey is still not accepted as the full membership at EU.

Thanks to the Chinese government for preserving the minority culture, All the Trukic minorities in China still uses the Arab writing script. All Turkic or Turkish groups in all other counyries, including Turkey, have changed to either Russian Cyrillic or Latin alphabet.

Today's Xinjinag was again under the power influence (protectorates and territory) of Tang Dynasty (618-907AD) and became territory of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911AD). Peoples Republic of China has taken over the territory sovereignty over Xinjiang from Qing Dynasty and Republic of China. 

** Uyghur emigrated in Xinjiang (840-850 AD):

Uyghur Empires (742-848 AD, 回纥 or 回鶻) was in today's Mongolia with the capital at Ordu Baliq that located 300 km west of Ulaanbaatar (close to Town of Hotont) and it was annihilated by Kyrgyz tribe in 848 AD. The Kyrgyz destroyed and burned down every Uyghur cities and villages throughout the empire. Three groups of Uyghurs escaped from the annihilation. One group escaped to today's Gansu area and assimilated with Han Chinese. Another group escaped to today's Turpan in central Xinjiang. The last group escaped further west and scattered over today's Kashgar in south Xinjiang, Kyrgyzstan, Tajkistan and Uzbekistan. 

Uyghurs has never had appreciable presence in north Xinjiang. They are mostly concentrated in Kashgar, Khotan, Aksu, and Kizilsu areas in south Xinjiang and Turpan in central Xinjiang. Uyghur is about 46% of the total population in Xinjiang, Han 40% and Kazak 7%. To call Xinjiang as "UYGHUR" Autonomous Region" is highly debatable. 

** Xiongnu, Turkics and Turks

Turkics/Turks are Turko-Mongolian Tribes originated from today's Mongolia area. The ancesters of Uyghurs (维吾尔) is Xiongnu (匈奴). The earliest written record of Xiongnu or Turk (Tujue, 突厥) in history was in Han Dynasty around 200BC. The earliest use of the term "Uyghur" in history was in Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD). Earlier historical written records of Xiongnu, Turk or Uyghur are all done by Han Chinese because they lacked the ability of reading and writing.

The Reading and writing is an essential for any moderate sophisticated society during the evolution. Some civilization had never reached to such level of sophistication before it vanished. The transition from nomadic to sedentary is an important evolution in the early human civilization history. The four oldest human civilizations all arose on the basins of major rivers; Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, Indus and Yellow Rivers, where the fertile alluvial farm lands were easily found.

Farming, villages, cities, state-nation, different social classes, political and economic systems are the backbone of the civilization. In the process of evolution, the need for written records for economic and political affairs occurred naturally. That was why all these old civilization had evolved the writings as earlier as in 5000BC or 6000BC 

The relatively primitive nature of Turkish/Turkic culture has always influenced by the outside cultures. First the Persian influence, then Arab, and European is the most recently. 

All Turkic people have learnt how to read and write very late in human hostory. Uyghur was the first Turkic group learnt the reading and writing after they emigrated from Kyrgyz annihilation in Mongolia to today's Turpan and Tarim Basin. The writing script they used was from the ancient Persian Sogdiana script. 

Arab had huge influence on Turks/Turkics after 800 or 900 AD as Turks/Turkics have adapted Islam religion and change into the Arabic scripts in writing. 

Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey, wanted to Europeanize Turks in 1920s with the intention to get rid of Arabic influence. He wanted Turks to dress like Europeans, and write like Europeans. However, after almost 60 years of continuous efforts, Turkey is still not accepted as the full membership at EU.

Thanks to the Chinese government for preserving the minority culture, All the Trukic minorities in China still uses the Arab writing script. All Turkic or Turkish groups in all other counyries, including Turkey, have changed to either Russian Cyrillic or Latin alphabet.
Crackdown: The report on Uigher protests that broke relations between China and Australia

Xinjiang province has long been the site of ethnic tensions between the Uighur population and Chinese rule. Amid fears that fanatical Uighurs are aligning with foreign extremists, the state crackdown is fiercer than ever. 

"A normal person wouldn't raise a butcher's knife to the elderly and children. Can we still call them human beings?", asks policeman Ainiding Memtimin. In May he was on the scene when a group of extremists threw explosives into a busy Urumqi marketplace, killing 39 people. A Uighur himself, like most locals he is baffled by such drastic violent acts. Yet the tensions that have simmered in this region are sitting on a knife edge. "Injustice is everywhere here, but we can't talk about it", says one Uighur farmer in a snatched interview. On Xinjiang's highways, cars are now being stopped for full airport-style security checks. The government keeps a close eye on religious institutions and veils for women and beards for men are actively discouraged. Teaching in the Uighur language is disappearing in schools and it's almost non-existent at universities. And it isn't just the Uighurs feeling the crackdown; enormous numbers of Han Chinese have been pressed into the province to water down the Uighurs' presence and influence. In some towns, payments are being offered for inter-marriage. But is China's central government using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? This report doggedly pushes past the press restrictions and government minders to tackle this difficult question.

Brief history of Uyghurs in Xinjiang (by Sogdia)

** Before Chinese Han Dynasty 200 BC:

Central Asia was a region predominately occupied by ancient Persian tribes such as the sedentary Sogdians ( 粟特), Chorasmians (花剌子模) and, the semi-nomadic such as Scythians (斯基泰, 西徐亞, 塞種), and Alans (奄蔡). The ancient sedentary population played an important role in the history of Central Asia. Tajiks, Pashtuns (普什图), Pamiris (塔吉克) and other Persian groups are still present in the region. The ancient Persian language (Dari) is still the official language in Afganistan and in some areas in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 

Turkic group of people, such as Uyghurs, came to Central Asia very late in history (after 800 AD), much later than Han Chinese did in 200 BC.

STORYLINE:
As a stop on the ancient Silk Road between China and Central Asia, Xijiang has long been regarded as the meeting point for China and the Arab world, and as the Olympic Torch arrives in Xinjiang, this gateway to Central Asia comes under the spotlight. 
Rich in natural resources, and unique in identity, China's Han people have been moving westwards for the past fifty years to exploit the coal and minerals, and now Uighur rights groups say their land, religion and culture is being threatened.

I was here to shoot a TV commercial deep into the mountains of Xinjiang, China.. Xinjiang is located Northwest of China and borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India and to the south is Tibet. We drove 3 hours into the mountains and parked by a local village. It was a great experience. The village people served us lamb and fried rice in the biggest pot i have ever seen. There were no toilets and the only power there was the generators that we brought. No cell phone reception up there either. We saw horses, goats, cows, etc. It was pure nature. I am not sure what the locals spoke there but obviously they dont speak English and they did not speak Chinese as well. Maybe they where Uyhur people I am not really sure. Maybe some of you can advise. Also what i thought was interesting was the fact that they bathed in the river and used mud as soap. I would not mind going off the grid for a month and just living here. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang
Xinjiang (Uyghur: شىنجاڭ‎‎, ULY: Shinjang; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕíntɕjɑ́ŋ]; Chinese: 新疆; pinyin: Xīnjiāng), officially Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,[5] is an autonomous region of China in the northwest of the country. It is the largest Chinese administrative division, the 8th largest country subdivision in the world, spanning over 1.6 million km2 and the most populous amongst the ten largest national subdivisions. It contains the disputed territory of Aksai Chin administered by China. Xinjiang contains China's smaller border with Russia (which is 40 km/24 mi long; the remainder of the China-Russia border is 3,605 km/2,240 mi long, and is taken up by the Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang provinces), but its other international borders are with Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It is also bordered, to the south, by Tibet, easily its longest border, when including the Eastern Tibetan disputed territories. It has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing region.

It is home to a number of ethnic groups including the Uyghur, Han, Kazakhs, Tajiks, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Mongols.[6] More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan.[7] Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.[8]
