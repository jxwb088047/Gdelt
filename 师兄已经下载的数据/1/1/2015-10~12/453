Softer approaches critical to counter extremism in Asia | The Jakarta Post
The recent bombing of the Erawan shrine in Bangkok has exposed serious security threats for Southeast Asian countries. It has highlighted the risks of illegal human trafficking, in this case in Asia’s Uighur community, and the rise of terrorist militancy. In a classic case of hardline measures proving counter-productive, the Uighurs, who are an ethnic minority in China, have been increasingly using Southeast Asia as a transit zone in their bid to travel to Turkey to escape the Chinese Government. China has long been criticized for the curtailment of the Uighurs’ religious freedom, and the Uighurs say the hardline actions by authorities have driven their dissent and exodus. The subsequent rise in the Uighurs’ presence in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, has led to their link-up with local separatist militants in the region with similar grievances. This movement was said to be the driver of the bombing in Bangkok — with allegations that the attack was revenge for the deportation of 109 Uighur Muslims back to China the month before. It is vital that following this terrible incident we take stock to consider what we can learn from it. One observation backed by growing evidence is that soft measures have become equally, if not more important, than hard measures in addressing the region’s extremist activities.____________________________________
Indonesia and Malaysia have taken positive measures to combat the rise of terrorist groups domestically.In recent years, Indonesia and Malaysia have taken positive measures to combat the rise of terrorist groups domestically. Laws have been strengthened and efforts to disrupt terrorist plots and prosecute perpetrators have stepped up.  Authorities are also now focusing on preventative measures by reaching out to those who could potentially be involved in extremist activities before they become at risk. Evidence shows one of the key ways to nullify messages promoting extremist and violent activities is to engage the community. For example, following the bomb attack in Bangkok, engaging the community in this region could help to raise cultural awareness and promote understanding of the Uighur ethnic identity and their plight. These kinds of advocacy efforts at a national level can prevent more individuals from being radicalized and help avert similar attacks from occurring again. Similar engagement activities are already in place in the region, and they have proven effective. The Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) in Singapore is one group that helps rehabilitate militants and their families to prevent them for being led further astray and drawn to the idea of self-radicalization. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) initiates dialogue and reasoning with imprisoned and potential terrorists to help denounce their radical thinking.The rise of social media in today’s digital age makes these approaches even more important as the threat of radicalization can come from a local or international source.Digital media also affords endless options for innovation in communication methods, which can be harnessed by organizations promoting terrorism. In the recent explosions in Bangkok, investigators found that social media techniques were used by members of the bomb network to communicate despite them not knowing each other. There is a need for contextualized engagement and advocacy efforts by each country to respond to the rise of extremism and terrorism.While the right balance of hard and soft measures will be vital to successfully combat terrorism in Southeast Asia, in the face of an increasingly complex security landscape, greater cooperation between countries and companies in the region is also needed. The region’s governments and private sector must look to how they can increase the surveillance of extremist activities together and share information to safeguard our communities. This will be a core focus of Asia’s inaugural Asia Pacific Homeland Security (APHS) conference and exhibition that will take place in Singapore later this month.The first forum of its kind in Asia, it will bring together leaders from across the globe to look at, debate, and analyze the security threats in the region and how the public and private sector can work together to combat the rise of extremist activities._______________________________The writer is a scheduled speaker at the APHS conference and exhibition on Oct. 27-30 in Singapore.
