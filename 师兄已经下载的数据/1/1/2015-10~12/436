How Did Radical Islam Get Spread Throughout the World? - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 30, 2015Leave a Comment
Much of the middle-east was once more secular. What changed? Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Where did violent Islamic extremism come from? In the wake of the horrific Paris attacks on Friday, November the 13, this is the question no one is asking — yet it is the most important one of all. If one doesn’t know why a problem emerged, if one cannot find its root, one will never be able to solve and uproot it.
Where did militant Salafi groups like ISIS and al-Qaida come from? The answer is not as complicated as many make it out to be — but, to understand, we must delve into the history of the Cold War, the historical period lied about in the West perhaps more than any other.”
