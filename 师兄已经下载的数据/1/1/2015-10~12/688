Turkey set to restore diplomatic ties with Israel. Why now? - Worldnews.com

 After more than five years of deep hostility, Turkey and Israel are poised to restore full diplomatic relations, which were severed in 2010 after Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists in a raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship. The former strategic allies reached a preliminary deal to normalize ties and exchange ambassadors during closed-door negotiations in Switzerland, Israeli officials said last week. ...

Ties between Turkey and Israel are reportedly improving after a five-year rift between the two sides. 

Speedy progress in talks to import Israeli natural gas by Turkey has raised expectations of a thaw in relations. Israel\'s once-strong ties with Turkey soured in 2010 after Israeli commandoes killed 10 Turkish peace activists on board a ship seeking to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip. Despite the tensions, Ankara and Tel Aviv have maintained bilateral relations including military and trade ties.

Relations between Turkey and Israel have been on ice ever since Israeli Commandos stormed a peace flotilla near the Gaza coast, killing Turkish activists. That was in 2010 and the two countries haven\'t had formal diplomatic ties since then. But, despite recent provocative comments made by Israel\'s defence minister, there are signs that Turkey-Israel relations could be about to change. The Newsmakers Ashraf Helmi looks at how relations between the two may finally be thawing...

DemocracyNow.org - Turkey has downgraded diplomatic ties with Israel and frozen military co-operation ahead of a long-awaited United Nations report on Israel\'s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid ship in 2010. The report accuses Israel of \"excessive and unreasonable\" force in its attack on the ship, Mavi Marmara — which killed nine people — and says Israel should issue a statement of regret and compensate the families of the dead as well as wounded passengers. But it also chides passengers aboard the Marmara and the other flotilla ships for what it calls a \"reckless\" attempt to breach Israel\'s blockade of the Gaza Strip. In a major development with broader implications, the U.N. report concludes that the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is legal under international law.

Israeli–Turkish relations refer to the bilateral ties between Israel and Turkey. Israel–Turkey relations were formalized in March 1949. Turkey was the first Muslim majority country to recognize the State of Israel.

Military, strategic, and diplomatic cooperation between Turkey and Israel were accorded high priority by both countries, which shared concerns with respect to the regional instabilities in the Middle East. According to a New York Times report in 1999, the strategic partnership between the two countries had the potential to alter Middle East politics: Trade and tourism were booming, the Israel Air Force practiced maneuvers in Turkish airspace and Israeli technicians were modernizing Turkish combat jets. There were also plans for high-tech cooperation and water sharing.

Relations between Israel and Turkey took a downturn during the term of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as Turkish Prime Minister. Though Erdoğan had paid an official visit to Israel in 2005 and initially had maintained business-as-usual relations, his strong anti-Israeli rhetoric is considered to have symbolized an intentional shift of Turkish interests in the Middle East and realignment from secular Israeli-oriented to Islamist pro-Arab stance of Turkish Republic. Most notably, the relations deteriorated after the 2008–09 Gaza War and the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. In March 2013, Israel apologized for the raid, opening path for normalized relations. However, despite US-mediation, no progress has been achieved in reconciliation through 2013. With the scandal over alleged Turkish involvement in exposure of spec...

in 2008, Turkey and other countries mentioned in Ezekiel made a Military and Economic Alliance with Russia. Ever since then Turkey has been slowly breaking ties with Israel. Now Turkey is in full blown agression against Israel.

Turkey\'s Prime Minister said Tuesday Ankara was suspending all military, industrial and economic ties with Israel and warned additional measures and sanctions would be taken against Jerusalem.
 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s announcement came a day after Turkey downgraded diplomatic ties with Israel ordering all senior Israeli diplomats to leave the country by Wednesday.

Erdogan also said he was considering visiting Gaza but would make a final decision after he visits Egypt later this month.
 
Defense Ministry Diplomatic-Security bureau head Amos Gilad said Turkey has a lot to lose by taking such steps.

Israel\'s Foreign Ministry said all diplomats above the rank of second secretary would leave Turkey and others would remain in their posts.
 
The latest steps taken by Turkey are in response to Israel\'s refusal to apologize for the deaths of nine Turkish activists in a raid on a Gaza flotilla boat last May. Israel expressed regret over the incident and saidit would be willing to pay into a joint fund for the victims\' families....

Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye), known officially as the Republic of Turkey ( Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (help·info)), is a Eurasian country located in Western Asia (mostly in the Anatolian peninsula) and in East Thrace in Southeastern Europe. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Bulgaria to the northwest; Greece to the west; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan (the exclave of Nakhchivan) and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The Mediterranean Sea and Cyprus are to the south; the Aegean Sea is to the west; and the Black Sea is to the north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between East Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia.
Turkey is one of the six independent Turkic states. The vast majority of the population are Muslims. The country's official language is Turkish, whereas Kurdish and Zazaki languages are spoken by Kurds and Zazas, who constitute 18% of the population.
