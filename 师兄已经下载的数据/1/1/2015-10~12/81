How France Should Respond To Terrorist Attacks
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 14, 20151 Comment
Humans have a strong revenge instinct, but it’s important to keep our cool after terrorist attacks. When our innocent civilians were killed in 9/11, we responded by killing exponentially more innocent civilians in Afghanistan in Iraq. It didn’t work. Collective punishment for individual crimes is immoral and counterproductive. It makes the problem worse. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and Elliot Hill (The Lip TV), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
I agree. We need to be intelligent with our actions. You cannot or should not act the same way as the “terrorists”. If you are lead blindly with anger there more lives could be lost and the end result would be same as the initial action. We need to follow the laws and not act like neanderthals like them. I am angry. But I also believe in due process.
