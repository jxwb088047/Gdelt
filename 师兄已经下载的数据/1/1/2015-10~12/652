According to French and Belgian intelligence officials, the terrorists who struck in Paris were not Syrian refugees but nationals from Europe. Those facts don’t matter to Chris Christie. He countered with a powerful, “how do YOU know?” Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“A majority of Americans d0n’t want to allow Syrian refugees into the U.S., according to two surveys taken in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks.
Fifty-six percent of Americans in an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released Wednesday disapprove of allowing refugees escaping violence to continue entering the U.S., whether from Syria or other nations. Forty-one percent of Americans feel that the U.S. should continue to allow in refugees.
A Bloomberg/Selzer poll, also released Wednesday, found similar sentiments when it asked respondents to identify the best way for the U.S. to handle the Syrian refugee crisis. Fifty-three percent of Americans in the survey say the best course of action is for the U.S. to deny Syrian refugees entry into the U.S.”*
