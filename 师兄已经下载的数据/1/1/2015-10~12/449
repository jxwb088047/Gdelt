China: Xinjiang police kill 28 terrorists behind coal mine attack
Chinese police hunted down and killed 28 terrorists in the troubled Xinjiang province, national media reported on Friday. 
The manhunt for the terror group began after a deadly attack at a coal mine in September, in which attackers armed with knives killed five police officials and 11 civilians.
One of the terrorists reportedly surrendered to the police, while the rest were killed, Xinhua reported. 
The police had called the coal mine attack in Sogan Colliery in the Aksu prefecture a "long-planned, well-prepared, large-scale attack by separatists". 
The Xinjiang province is one of the most restive regions in China, with deadly violence often reported.
China has seen a spate of knife attacks in recent years, many carried out by Uighur Muslims in response to alleged religious repression by the Chinese government.
