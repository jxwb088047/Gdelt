ISIS has a new song in Mandarin calling Chinese Muslims to jihad: Shanghaiist
The Islamic State has released a catchy new song in Mandarin Chinese in an attempt to recruit Chinese Muslims to join their fight. China, the most populous country in the world, is home to more than 30 million Muslims.
The song, which can be heard here, is four minutes long. In it, a male voice, digitally enhanced using reverb and harmonies, chants these lyrics, translation provided by The Wall Street Journal:
A century of slavery, leaving that shameful memory.
Deep in ignorant slumber, the nightmare continues on.
A century of slavery, leaving that shameful memory.
Deep in ignorant slumber, the nightmare continues on.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.
To this day we guard the Koran and the Sunnah.
No power can stop our progress.

In June, ISIS released a propaganda video featuring their oldest member, an 80-year-old Uighur grandfather, describing his decision to leave China after decades of oppression and join the Islamic State. The same video also shows Uighur children dressed in military garb, interviewed about joining the Islamic State. The man and the children all speak the same Turkic language.
It's also possible that they are targeting ethnic Hui people, who count for around 10 million of China's Muslims. Although they have better relations with the majority Han than Uighurs, and speak Mandarin, Hui also practice Sunni Islam, which could lead IS to consider them natural allies.
More likely, the choice of using Mandarin was a direct warning to the Chinese government. Last month, the Islamic State executed a Chinese national. Soon after they also released a video which implicitly recognized Taiwan as its own country while calling for its destruction.
In response, China has vowed to bring ISIS to justice and also heightened its crackdown against Islamist insurgents in Xinjiang, even going so far as to use flamethrowers to hunt down militants hiding in caves.
