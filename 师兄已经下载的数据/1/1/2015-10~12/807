Joe Scarborough appeared on Hugh Hewitt\'s radio show to offer his reaction the Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote approving military force in Syria today, zeroing in on Republican Sen. Marco Rubio\'s decision to vote against the resolution. Scarborough called Rubio\'s vote \"absolutely stunning.\"

Scarborough went on the say that the formerly \"neo-conservative\" Rubio\'s thinking appears to be steered by the actions of his more tea party-aligned colleagues Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). \'I really thought that he would take the classic Reagan position, that he would speak out as a friend of Israel.\'\"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

A Short Bio on Rand Paul
Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Dr. Paul has proven to be an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Rand has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope.

A devoted husband and father, Dr. Paul and his family live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Rand owned his own ophthalmology practice and performed eye surgery for 18 years. As a hard-working and dedicated physician--not a career politician--Rand Paul came to Washington to shake things up and to make a difference.

Dr. Paul has been married for 24 years to Kelley Ashby Paul of Russellville, Kentucky, and together, they have three sons: William, 21; Duncan, 18; and Robert, 15. He regularly volunteered to coach teams for each of his three sons in Little League baseball, soccer, and basketball. Rand ...

In an interview on CNBC, he suggested the U.S. institute a \"no fly zone\" or what he referred to as a \"safe zone\" that would be protected by U.S. airpower. When pressed on the risk that Russia would challenge the NFZ Rubio assured the host that Russia would not, but if they did...\"We would have a problem\".

Do you think so Rubio? Do you? It\'s this kind of total ignorance and ineptitude our would-be leaders showcase on almost a daily basis that gives me pause. It\'s scary to think he might one day control the greatest Army on earth.

ABOUT MARCO RUBIO
For Marco Rubio, America is not just the country where he was born -- it is the place that changed his family’s history. His parents came to America from Cuba in 1956 to pursue a better life. His father became a bartender, and his mother became a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. Growing up in Las Vegas and Miami, Marco watched how his parents worked hard and sacrificed to give their children a life better than their own. They never made it big, but they were successful. They achieved the American Dream. And that is why he is running for president. For too many people, the American Dream feels impossible. Opportunity and success seems far away. But Marco has worked tirelessly to restore the hope and promise that the American Dream is real and that every American can achieve their own unique version of that dream. As U.S. Senator, Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative, conservative ideas to address the fundamental issues our country is facing and to restore hope in the American Dream. His ideas are firmly rooted in this simple truth – the American economy has changed significantly in recent decades and our policies must change with it. He has proposed conservative refor...
