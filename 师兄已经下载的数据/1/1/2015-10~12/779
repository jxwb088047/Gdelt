Ben Carson Thinks China Is Invading Syria And ISIS Is Easy
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 14, 2015Leave a Comment
Ben Carson’s lack of knowledge or even interest in foreign policy is finally becoming an issue in this campaign. This is due to some comments he made during the last debate. Namely that China was moving into Syria, and that handling ISIS is easy. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola (Think Tank), Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and Elliot Hill (The Lip TV), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“During the Republican presidential debate Tuesday night, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who’s running neck-and-neck with businessman Donald Trump, made a curious claim. Chinese forces, he said, were in Syria and involved in the civil war there. A day later, Armstrong Williams, a Carson adviser, backed his candidate up. And on Thursday, the White House entered the fray.
“I have not seen any evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria,” National Security Adviser Susan Rice told reporters at the White House Thursday.
Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, in response to a follow-up question, then doubled-down on Rice’s assertion, saying, “It’s worth stepping back and noting China makes it a practice to not get extended into military conflicts in the Middle East. Their policy over many years and decades has been to not be overextended in military exercises.””*
