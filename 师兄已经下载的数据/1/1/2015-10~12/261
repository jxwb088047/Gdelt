(AP) -- The latest on the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California (all times local): 5:25 p.m. The FBI has not said what it was looking for in a raid early Saturday at the home next door to where San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook's family used to live in Riverside, California.

Why did they do it? The California rampage that left 14 dead shows the motives behind mass violence can be complex and difficult to determine. The careful planning, multiple shooters and military-style weapons might seem to match up with recent terror attacks. But other circumstances — killing people known to an attacker, for example — could be more in line with the deep anger...

On the scene live at the worst shooting massacre i\'ve ever witnessed out here in my home town of San Bernardino California where I have lived my whole life. Sadly 3 gunmen went to the San Bernardino regional office and killed 14 people and injuring 17 and ran away, a little later the SUV was found and the police shot and killed 2 and one was detained. The POS they said was responsibles name is \"Syed Farook\" an ex San Bernardino county employee. My love and thoughts go out to all the victims of my hometown San Bernardino, CA.

An employee who was in the building where the San Bernardino shooting took place Wednesday shared a video from the scene with KPCC.

Gabi Flores gave KPCC permission to post the video taken inside the Inland Regional Center, where she works as a customer services coordinator. 

In the video, you can see an officer leading the group to safety. At one point, he says: \"Try to relax, try to relax. I\'ll take a bullet before you do, that\'s for damn sure.\"

San Bernardino Police confirmed that at least 14 people are dead and 14 people have been injured in the mass shooting. Police say there were up to three suspects who may have left the area in a dark-colored SUV. They are still at large. 

“They came prepared to do what they did as if they were on a mission,\" said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan in a press conference Wednesday.

Today a social services center in San Bernardino, CA was the target of up to three terrorists. Witnesses said one to three armor-clad, armed individuals were involved. Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz (Turner Classic Movies), and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

- \"Around 11 a.m., at least one shooter opened fire in San Bernardino at the Inland Regional Center, a facility that serves people with developmental disabilities.
- Preliminary numbers: At least 14 people were killed and at least 14 wounded, the San Bernardino police chief said.
- Police said there were one to three assailants, who were heavily armed and possibly wearing body armor.
- No one is in custody. Police are searching for a black Yukon SUV that drove away from the shooting.
- Investigators are not sure whether the shooting was an act of terrorism, an FBI official said.
- Police seek the public\'s help finding the attackers. Tipsters can call ( 866) 346-7632 ; to stay anonymous, call (800) 78CRIME.”*

Please Read: (Very Important)... I was watching a press conference today - believe it or not on CNN - with the doctors from the hospital that took in the alleged casualties from the San Bernardino Shooting. I decided to tape it. Good thing to because one of the doctors that spoke - well let\'s just say - you won\'t be seeing him on the dinner news. The name of the doctor is Dr. Michael Neeki 

This is from People Magazine and is about Dr. Michael Neeki the same man that this video is about. 

This story gets weirder by the day.

 Thanks to Shawn Anderson for the heads up.

Amid the tragedy of last Wednesday\'s mass shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 and injured 21 were uplifting stories of heroism. 

One such story is that of Dr. Michael Neeki, an emergency room doctor who doubles as a member of the local SWAT team. At a Monday press conference, Neeki said he was working his shift at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in nearby Colton, California, when he got a radio call about an active shooter. 

He knew he had to rush to the scene, but before he did, he said he had to \"make sure the campus care was not compromised.\" So, he said, \"I took a couple of my residents to encourage the next generation of physicians to do what I do.\" 

Neeki hopped in his car and headed to what he termed \"the hot zone.\" He said it took him about 25 minutes \"to get through the blockades, traffic, and the issues we had to deal wi...

14 people were killed at the Inland regional center in California. The same location where in days past active shooter drills had taken place. Now the police say this shooting started because of a dispute at a party. At this point the shooters went home. Dressed in what mainstream media calls assault clothing and grabbed assault rifles. There are also reports of bombs at the scene. Which tells me that this is a premeditated attack. Nurses in the center thought today\'s shooting was a drill. This occurred in a area with gun control already in place and monsters like Hillary Clinton have taken to Twitter to call for more Gun Control. The weapons used were illegally obtained, so how can more fun control counter that? This has false flag written all over it? What do you think?...

Investigation of the San Bernardino false flag, operation gladio / northwoods shooting, using only details that slipped through the mainstream propaganda \"news\" channels, dispatch recordings, eyewitness accounts or footage, and basic common sense! 

RIP to the victims and please accept my apology if this offends or upsets anyone in any way.

If you were hellbent on going to hell and you wanted to use a tragedy to gain political leverage, by any means necessary. You wouldn\'t shoot up a brothel or a drug house with poor souls, sadly no one would care. No, you\'d target a childrens school, a family movie theater or a centre where good people help the disabled!


Very interesting documents I came across recently, that unequivocally prove terrorism and the unjust killing of anyone has absolutely no place in Islam:

The awakening against and raising awareness of satanic forces, should never cease. Knowing is half the battle. All humans are one family and we have a common enemy. In my honest opinion I think he\'s soon going to play the big moves he\'s been planning for a long long time now.

This isn\'t fear mongering, because the only One we should fear is the Almighty who has power over all things.
