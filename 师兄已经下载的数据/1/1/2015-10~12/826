Trump On Killing Reporters - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiDecember 22, 2015Leave a Comment
It’s pretty clear Donald Trump is not a fan of the press, he’s made outrageous attacks against the press many times but the most recent attack may be the worst. Trump is addressing the controversy after his appearance on Morning Joe in which he was asked about Putin killing reporters. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks breaks it down.
“The Republican front-runner — who frequently lambasts the media as “scum” or “horrible” — reassured reporters at rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Monday that he had no desire to execute the press who cover him.
“I hate some of these people, I hate ’em,” Trump told the crowd. “I would never kill them. I would never do that.”
“Uh, let’s see, uh?” he said aloud, his voice rising. “No, I would never do that.”*
