Excellent Birthday Experience | the Beijinger
I was looking for somewhere to have a casual meal with friends for my Birthday. I didn't want anywhere that pricey or fancy, just somewhere with a private room where we could all catch up, have some beers and eat some good food. Crescent Moon gave me exactly what I was looking for.
We booked the bigger of two private rooms they have which has the advantage of a round table. It's easier to talk to everyone and share food this way, rather than putting two or three regular tables together (like another group had done in the front). The room itself is decorated nicely in a very 'Xinjiang' style and they even put "love heard" placemats out for us! Not really in fitting with the occaision or the rest of the decor but ... this is China. We didn't have to pay for the room itself.
We ordered a couple of Da Pan Ji's, some noodle dishes, vegetable dishes, a soup, a few other meat dishes as well as a lot of Nan. All of it arrived in good time and was excellent. We drank the Xinjiang beer and it made a nice change from Yanjing although it wasn't anything to rave about either.
I would agree with another review here that the manageress/main server can be a bit surly but she has her moments. We were mostly served by the waitress they have working there. She has a great attitude, good manners and is very friendly. My friends sang happy birthday to me and when the owner heard he came in any wishes me happy birthday. They gave a small gift too!
When we arrived and as we were leaving the main restaurant was almost completely full. It is popular with foreigners but there was also a good number of Chinese as well.
I'd definitely recommend trying this place. It's also a stones throw from Slow Boat so combine the two for a pretty good evening!
