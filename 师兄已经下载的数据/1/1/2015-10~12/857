전면에 나선 김정은 문고리권력...\'감찰 칼잡이\'
To kick off the new year，... North Korea revealed that it′s leader Kim Jong－un paid homage to his father and grandfather at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. 
But aside from that， little else is known.
What bout his priorities and who will be by his side.
According to our Connie Kim， analysts are looking between the lines for clues. 
When Kim Jong－un visited the Kumsuan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang on the first day of 2016，...
standing to his far right was Jo Yon－jun ， a first deputy of the ruling Workers′ Party′s Organization and Guidance Department. 
It was the first time Jo was spotted in the first row... with party secretaries who sit much higher up on the power ladder.
The 75－year－old is known to be in charge of executing senior officials， and his placement in last Friday′s line－up is grabbing attention because it coincided with the North Korean leader′s New Year′s speech which focused on efforts to root out corruption.
″We must intensely fight against corruption， bureaucracy， and forces that disrupt unity among our workers.″
Other officials that took the front rows were army politburo chief Hwang Pyong－so ， defense chief Pak Yong－sik ， the Korean People′s Army chief of general staff Ri Yong－gil ， and state security minister Kim Won－hong . 
Experts say these men will likely remain as close aides to leader Kim this year. 
″The timing of this change can be seen as top officials pledging full support of the Kim Jong－un regime ahead of the 7th Congress of the Workers′ Party of Korea.″

\"North Korea\'s leader Kim Jong-un was \"very drunk\" when he ordered the execution of two aides close to his purged uncle, according to Japanese newspaper reports.

The young leader ordered the execution of two aides after they reportedly failed to respond immediately to a request to hand over a profitable business to the military.

The two aides were close to Jang Song-thaek, Kim\'s uncle, who only weeks later was dramatically stripped of his powerful posts and executed in an effort by the leader to consolidate his grip on power.\"* Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz, John Iadarola, and Jimmy Dore break it down on The Young Turks.

Des enfants de la ville syrienne de Daraya, dans la province de Damas, ont organisé un sit-in mercredi 9 mars pour protester contre le siège dont leur cité est victime. 

Ils demandent que de l\'aide humanitaire puisse leur parvenir, selon une vidéo tournée sur place par des activistes locaux.

Sur cette vidéo, on peut voir les enfants écrire SOS avec leurs corps, ou bien tenir des banderoles dans plusieurs langues, disant \"Je veux des chips et des biscuits\", \"Enfants de Syrie, enfants de Daraya, c\'est l\'humanité qu\'on assassine\", etc. 

Un groupe d\'enfants tient même une banderole s\'adressant à Kim Jong-un, le dictateur nord-coréen : \"Cher Kim Jong-un, nous avons appelé à l\'aide les chefs d\'Etat du monde entier pour lever le siège, mais en vain. Pouvez-vous essayer?\"...

A senior North Korean ruling party official and a top aide to leader Kim Jong Un has died in a car accident, the state news agency reported on Wednesday, the latest dramatic demise in the close circle of deputies to the country\'s leader. 

Kim Yang Gon, who was a secretary of the Workers\' Party and the head of its United Front Department, the unit that handles the North\'s ties with South Korea, was Kim Jong Un\'s \"closest comrade, a solid revolutionary partner\", KCNA said.

Kim was part of a high-level delegation that held talks in August after the rival states exchanged artillery fire, raising tensions to one of its highest points in recent years.

Those talks produced an agreement that ended the standoff and for the two sides to reopen dialogue to improve ties.

Kim had grown visibly closer to Kim Jong Un recently, appearing alongside the young leader at various farm and factory inspections and diplomatic meetings. 
He was an experienced adviser with a broad understanding of foreign affairs, according to Michael Madden, an expert on North Korea\'s leadership.

\"With regard to South Korean policy, Kim Yang Gon had a very good social network and was a good interlocutor for the North with the South.\"
South Korea expressed condolences in a message from its Unification Minister sent through the Panmunjom truce village on the militarized border, an official said.
