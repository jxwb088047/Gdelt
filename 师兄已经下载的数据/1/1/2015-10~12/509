The difference being of course that their country is being occupied by China. Not that it justifies any act of violence, but it's important to be honest about these things.
Xinjiang is not really a part of China except by force, so this problem is not going away anytime soon.
The east turkishstan state was self proclaimed on earth between 1934-1944, an ill fated nation which was never has been recognised by the world. The argument of "A country being occupied by China" is baseless and it is just a "Myth".It is even worst than comparing with the Palestine state, the United Nations recognised the legitimate status of a Palestine state. But of course western critics wont recognizing China's rule of Xinjiang and Tibet, they have their own "Political calculations", and claiming it "Occupations".
While Israel has NEVER occupying the Palestine state no matter how many people of both sides died. This is the so called "Anti semitic", it is a crime.......blah blah!
The western standard is : All yours is wrong and all mine is right! End of discussion.
“China is a victim of terrorism,” Xinhua said in a commentary late Thursday.
No, China is a victim of its own thirst for resources at the expense of the freedom and liberty of any neighbors who happen to live on top of said resources. When the Chinese government releases its chokehold on Tibet and gives up its adventurism in the South China Sea, then I'll consider shedding a tear for it.
China just took the advantage to take out a case of people whom they thought was a nuisance labeling them terrooist but we know they weren't.
Lived in Beijing and spent a month traveling in Xinjiang back in '86-'87, and even then I was struck by their mutual, ferocious antipathy. Too bad for the Uighers that any movement for self-rule (not to mention independence) will only be cast by Nanzhonghai as "terrorism," no matter how peaceful or justified.
