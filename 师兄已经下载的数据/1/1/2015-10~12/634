Democracynow.org - On Saturday, thousands rallied in New York City against police brutality as part of three days of protest called \"Rise Up October.\" Some 40 families across the country impacted by police violence participated in the event alongside scholars such as Dr. Cornel West and Chris Hedges, as well as celebrities including playwright Eve Ensler and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. We bring some of the voices from Saturday’s rally, including Kadiatou Diallo, mother of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who died on February 4, 1999, in a hail of 41 police bullets as he put the key in his door. The New York Police Department’s Street Crime Unit would later be disbanded. \"How many more victims were unjustly killed since Amadou Diallo?\" Kadiatou Diallo said. \"We can’t begin to count. I went to many funerals. I connected with many families. We’re not bitter. The law enforcement should know we are not against them. We are not against them. We are anti-police brutality.”

The hosts of Fox News’ Outnumbered lashed out at Quentin Tarantino on Monday after the legendary director participated in a Black Lives Matter protest against police brutality over the weekend.

Fox News host Harris Faulkner reported that the New York City police union was calling to boycott Tarantino’s movies because he had participated in the protest, which were organized by philosopher Cornel West and Carl Dix, founder of the Revolutionary Communist Party.

“It’s never appropriate to call cops murderers,” Republican strategist Tony Sayegh opined. “This was organized, remember, by a very radical group. I think they are some form of the Communist Party in the United States.”

“How do you show love by calling cops murderers?” he asked. “But let’s not give Quentin Tarantino too much attention because he’s a fool.”

Co-host Sandra Smith accused Tarantino of “a misuse of power.”

“He’s using his power to make a statement for everyone,” Smith said. “And in the act of love and act of support, he’s hurting an entire community and hurting the police force and making for a very dangerous situation.”

Faulkner agreed that the Academy Award-winning director “could potentially make it worse.”

“He has made violence humorous in his films,” Faulkner noted. “Pulp Fiction, a feel-good movie about a lot of killing and a lot of blood, but in the context of ‘Don’t you find it funny?\'”

According to co-host Andrea Tantaros, police officers were being killed because of liberal policies.

“That’s what progressives do, they push these policies that make no sense through,” she remarked. “They rui...

Quentin Jerome Tarantino (pronunciation: /ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer and actor. He has received many industry awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA and the Palme d'Or and had been nominated for an Emmy and Grammy.
Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino was an avid film fan. His career began in the late 1980's, when he wrote and directed My Best Friend's Birthday. Its screenplay would form the basis for True Romance. In the early 1990s, he began his career as an independent filmmaker with films employing nonlinear storylines and the aestheticization of violence. His films include Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (2003, 2004), Death Proof (2007), and Inglourious Basterds (2009).
His movies are generally characterized by stylistic influences from grindhouse, kung fu, and spaghetti western films. Tarantino also frequently collaborates with his friend and fellow filmmaker Robert Rodriguez.
