Glenn Greenwald: CNN Has Basically Become State TV War Propaganda « InvestmentWatch
Cenk Uygur, hosts of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
““Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter asked Greenwald how he backs up his assertion that “the press is hungry for war” in the wake of the Paris attacks. In an article criticizing CNN’s post-Paris attack coverage, Greenwald said “CNN has basically become state TV.”
“The lesson that the American media has supposedly learned after the 9/11 attack,” Greenwald began, “was that allowing political and military intelligence officials to make all kinds of claims without scrutinizing and questioning and pushing them back is a really destructive thing to do.”
“It propagandizes the population,” he argued. “It leads to things like torture, Guantanamo, the attack on Iraq based on false pretenses.”
“I think that CNN has actually unfortunately led the way in this,” Greenwald bluntly stated about the network’s coverage following the terror attacks in Paris.
“I think the worst example, probably the most despicable interview we’ve seen in the last several years were two CNN anchors, John Vause and Isha Sesay, who told a French Muslim political activist that he and all other Muslims bear, quote, ‘responsibility’ for the attack in Paris because all Muslims must somehow be responsible,” Greenwald explained. In that interview, both anchors confronted their Muslim guest about a collective Muslim “responsibility” in the wake of the terror attacks.”*
