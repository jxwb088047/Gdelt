Trump Fans Can't Stop Attacking Protesters - TYT Network
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiDecember 30, 2015Leave a Comment
There have been a lot of attacks against protesters at Donald Trump rallies. Now we have a “celebrity boxer” taking part. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Another protester was violently ejected from a Donald Trump rally Monday night in New Hampshire — this time by a self-described celebrity boxer.
A long-haired man shouted out “fascist” as the Republican frontrunner complained about the local Union-Leader newspaper had endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over him, reported the Daily Mail.
A Trump supporter later identified as Todd ‘The Punisher’ Poulton, pounced on the man, and witnesses said they knocked over an elderly man in the scuffle.”*
