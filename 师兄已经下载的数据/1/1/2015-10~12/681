Donald Trump: A Secret Democrat? | msnbc...
This is a mash-up of a bunch of different news footage where #Donald #Trump has shown his true #liberal colors over the past 20 years or so. Although he is running as a #republican his history suggests that he is much more of a liberal progressive who is just running as a conservative because it is politically expedient.

This is my daily Vlog. I just talk about stuff that matters to me. It could be news stories, politics, human interest items, political activism, advocating for out constitutional rights, trying to educate folks on the need for a smaller federal government and increased states rights. I am a libertarian/constitutionalist and a Christian, though I haven\'t found a modern church that I am willing to ever set foot in more than once.
