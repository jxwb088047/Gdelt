Trump: Steal Iraqi Oil
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiNovember 10, 2015Leave a Comment
Donald Trump is very clear about his intentions in the Middle-East. He wants to steal their oil. The oil. O-I-L. Oil. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Donald Trump says any plan to defeat the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) will hinge on cutting off the revenue stream that the terrorist group takes in from oil.
“I’m looking to take the oil. I want to take the oil. I want the oil,” Trump said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.
“We have to stop the source of money, and the source of money is oil,” the businessman added.
He said the Russian plane crash that ISIS has claimed responsibility for poses a new threat to American interests.
“You know, if you stop transportation, I mean, you’re talking about the blood — the blood of the world and we’re going to have to be very, very strong,” Trump said.
“We’re going to have to take away the energy, the fuel, the money from ISIS.””*
