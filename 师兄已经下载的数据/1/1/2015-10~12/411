Ezra Levant of TheRebel.Media asks, did you see that story about the 14-year-old kid in Dallas, Ahmed Mohamed, who made a home-made clock, took it to school but because he’s a Muslim, his teacher called the principal and they called the cops who arrested him, interrogated him and suspended him because they thought he was making a bomb?

But what about my take on the story? That the kid didn’t make a clock at all. He made something look as bomb-like as possible, on purpose, and brought it to school. All his teacher told him was, don’t walk around with it in case it worries people. But Ahmed did that anyhow. He took it to another class where the alarm went off, making that teacher suspicious, just like he knew it would. Then he was passive aggressive with the cops, who immediately pegged him as a hoaxer.

What if, just like his dad, a crazy fake sheikh who ran for president of Sudan and who participates in incendiary stunts, he’s a media hound?

Oh — and his sister was suspended for allegedly making bomb threats, too.

No wonder this boy is being invited to the White House. If Obama finds out the whole story, he’ll probably appoint Ahmed as an ambassador.

That’s why leftists love him. Not because of what really happened. But because of what they can say happened, to shame and blame America.

MRCTV's Dan Joseph asks George Mason students what they would think if they saw Ahmed's suitcase clock.
A 14-year-old North Texas boy will not face charges after he was suspended over a homemade clock that teachers, administrators and police found suspicious.

Ahmed Mohamed, who is Muslim, was arrested at MacArthur High School in Irving on Monday afternoon.

He said he enjoys tinkering with electronics and took the clock to school to show his engineering teacher. But an alarm on the clock went off in English class and his teacher confiscated it.

"I told them it's a clock. And they told me, 'Why would you bring a clock to school?' And I was like to tell time. And the officer said, 'There's clocks here, clocks here, clocks around you everywhere.' And I told him that I wanted to impress my teachers so that I could feel appreciated for it, but instead I got the police called on me," he said.

Police searched his belongings and removed him from school in handcuffs.

Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said Mohamed originally was not very forthcoming and the school was concerned that the device was possibly the infrastructure for a bomb. Officers acted in an abundance of caution.

“It was a very suspicious device. We live in an age where you can't take things like that to school. Of course we've seen across our country horrific things happen. We have to err on the side of caution," Boyd said.

In the state of Texas a person can be found guilty of possessing a hoax bomb if the device is intended to bring fear. But, police no longer believe Mohamed’s device is dangerous and he will not be charged.

"We found no evidence to support the perception that he intended to create alarm," Boyd said.

This video shows that the supposed clock invention by a 14 year old is in fact not an invention. The 'clock' is a commercial bedside alarm clock removed from its casing. There is nothing to indicate that the clock was even assembled by the child. I suspect this was brought into school to create an alarmed reaction. 

So, Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. President, Make Magazine (which should know better), and others: You've been duped. Please do recognize youths of all backgrounds who create wonderful inventions with electronics. The kid making press around the world did not invent or build a clock.

The Texas teen, who was arrested after school officials mistook his homemade digital clock for a bomb, says he wants to be an engineer.
In the case of Ahmed Mohamed, the muslim student arrested for bringing a clock to school, we here at TYT told you conservatives would start attacking him. Cue Sarah Palin… Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said on Saturday that arresting and suspending Ahmed Mohamed, the ninth grader who brought a homemade clock to school, was totally reasonable.

Palin called initial media reports of Mohamed's arrest "fishy" and said that school officials were totally justified in thinking that his clock, made out of a pencil box, was a bomb.

"Yep, believing that's a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history," she wrote in a Facebook post in which she shared pictures of her kids' pencil boxes. "Right. That's a clock, and I'm the Queen of England.””*

Did Ahmed Mohamed invent a clock or create a hoax bomb. Turns out the clock is an old 1980's Radio Shack model. He simply mounted the parts in a metal box and claimed it as his own invention.

Tonight on "The Kelly File," Judge Andrew Napolitano reacted to allegations that Texas teenager Ahmed Mohamed did not create a clock and instead simply took apart an existing clock and transplanted the guts into a pencil box.
A 14-year-old student in Irving Texas was arrested after he showed up to school and provided a clock that he created to his science teachers. The science teachers assumed this was a bomb or could be a bomb. They called authorities and he was promptly arrested.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian (The Point) hosts of The Young Turks discuss. When will we not have to deal with innocent students not having to be accosted like this? Let us know in the comments.

“On Sunday, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed built a homemade clock. It wasn't especially difficult for him, and the result wasn't polished — it looked like a mess of wires and circuitry. He was still adjusting to life as a high schooler, and he wanted to bring in something cool to show his teachers.

Mohamed eagerly showed several teachers the clock and explained what it was, but he didn't get the congratulations he was expecting. Instead, he left school in handcuffs.

Young Mohamed's story has drawn accusations of racism and Islamophobia, and many — scientists, technologists and members of the general public alike — are expressing shock and outrage. But as with any incident of discrimination, especially in science, the truth is that we aren't really shocked. And that's the worst part.”

On Monday 9/14, Ahmed Mohammed, a 14-year-old Texan kid, made the national headlines after he was suspended from school for bringing an alarm clock he had supposedly built himself. Later Barack Obama tweeted "Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great."

Clockmaking whiz kid Ahmed Mohamed racked up weeks of suspension, could have been ‘head of a gang’: teachers 
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ahmed-mohamed-head-gang-teacher-article-1.2378712
Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old Muslim student at Texas' Irving MacArthur High, brought what he thought was an inventive showcase for a class project. Instead, his school day ended in handcuffs.

The 9th grader, who Dallas News describes as a smart kid who "makes his own radios and reparis his own go-kart," brought in a homemade clock to class. But rather than being impressed, his teacher said it resembled a bomb, and he was sent to the principal's office, where a police officer arrested him in handcuffs. The clock apparently had a circuit board, a metal case, and a digital clock display—like any old digital clock—but the authorities responded with, "It looks like a movie bomb to me."

A police spokesman said there was "no reason to think it was dangerous"; the verdict leans toward a clear case of Islamophobia. Ahmed said when he was brought to the principal an officer (who he's never seen before) looked at him and said, "Yup, that's who I thought it was." The unfair treatment of a harmless young student has Twitter trending with the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed. 

Above, Ahmed talks about how he's always been an inventor and details of his traumatizing day, in which he was searched, interrogated, and arrested. The most disheartening part of this is that schools should be encouraging Ahmed's innovation, but instead he's faced with discouragement. Ahmed, we stand with you.
