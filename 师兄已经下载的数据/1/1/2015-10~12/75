Tremors Felt in Xinjiang, No Casualties Reported
An earthquake in Tajikistan on Monday was felt in the south of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China, according to local sources.
Residents of the prefectures of Kashgar, Hotan, Aksu and Kizilsu Kirgiz felt strong tremors, and people in buildings rushed out to safety.
"Ceiling lights swayed and furniture moved," said a witness in Kashgar. "The jolt lasted for less than a minute."
Zhang Yong, vice head of the seismological bureau of Xinjiang, told Xinhua that they had not received reports of casualties as of 5:20 p.m. Beijing Time. "We remain on alert," he said.
Some railway sections in the south of Xinjiang closed after the quake.
An earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale at a depth of 10 km struck 367 km east of Tajikistan's capital of Dushanbe at 7:50 a.m. GMT on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. No casualties were immediately reported.
