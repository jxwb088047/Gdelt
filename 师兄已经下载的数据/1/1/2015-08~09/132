Fox News has been very clear about its agenda against Black Lives Matter, in fact they are pushing to label them as a hate group. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian (The Point), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Fox News\'s Bill O\'Reilly also made the connection on his Monday night show, calling Black Lives Matter \"a hate group.\" (His two guests disagreed.)

By the sheriff\'s own admission, there\'s nothing establishing a motive or linking Black Lives Matter to the shooting. But by making the connection in his remarks, he planted the seeds that critics of Black Lives Matter and outlets like Fox News needed to cultivate and grow their big plant of bullshit.”*

SURF CITY, NORTH CAROLINA — The chief of police in Surf City, North Carolina was forced to retire or be fired after posting a controversial Facebook rant that accused the Black Lives Matter movement of being a terrorist group that is targeting police.

According to WISTV, 35-year veteran of the force Mike Halstead decided to bow out and retire instead of being fired and he was granted 60 days severance pay. His rant not only includes his feelings about the Black Lives Matter movement, but also President Obama, the media\'s reaction to police brutality and violence against police, as well as blaming the race problem in America on African-American leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Eric Holder and Louis Farrakhan. Halstead makes several grammatical and spelling errors, but his message is clear: \"Law Enforcement is fed up with this murderous society who want to take out those who protect and serve.\"

Halstead goes on to say: \"America wake up, all of you black, white, Mexican whatever you need the police, we do not need you. End this Black Lives Matter bull shit and start a movement that all lives matter.\"

Some citizens of Surf City staged a protest outside the police department, expressing their disagreement with the city officials\' response to the rant. They didn\'t think Halstead should have been forced to retire.

Sonya Patrick, a local member of the Black Lives Matter movement in Surf City, told WISTV: \"I think he should be removed from office, he shouldn\'t be allowed to benefit from a retirement package. He should not benefit from taxpayers dollars because these are ...

Fox News’s “The Five” recently had a segment attacking the Black Lives Matter movement. They lamented how it feels uncomfortable when black people blame them personally for slavery, which happens never. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"The Black Lives Matter movement, which grew from repeated instances of unarmed black men being killed by white police officers, excludes white people and puts them in an \"impossible situation,\" white Fox News hosts bemoaned on Thursday\'s episode of \"The Five.\" 

Guest host Brian Kilmeade said he was tired of being blamed for everything.

\"We’re in an impossible situation,\" Kilmeade lamented. \"If you come up to us and say there was slavery in this country 220 years ago and white people did it and I hold you responsible, what do you want me, Melissa, Greg and Kimberly to say?…\"\"*

Police Chief was fired for freedom of speech. He rightfully called out the black lives matter group a terrorist organization. His whole post is stating facts and unfortunately the Far Left had to shut him up.

Police Chiefs Facebook post:

Open letter from a Police Chief , this Black Lives Matter group is nothing more than an American born terrorist group brought on by the lie of the hands up don’t shoot during the criminal thug Michael Brown incident. The FBI and other Government Law Enforcement groups need to step up and put a stop to this. The Government and blacks would not tolerate the White Supremacist group to march through the streets and call for the murders of a race of people and a group of public servants. I agree there is a race problem in this country. It is not brought on by police officer doing their sworn duty, it is brought on by the government, the President and his cronies Al Sharpton, who is a criminal tax evader (but has the support of our so called President), Jessi Jackson, Eric Holder and that ignorant S.O.B. Farrakhan who should be charged with solicitation for murder, lord knows a white man would be arrested for the same actions of idiot Farakhan. I am sure there are many hard working Black people who will agree with me. I have been a Police Officer for 35 years. I do not judge anyone by the color of their skin, but by there actions. A criminal is a criminal whether a police officer or any other profession. I will not state statistics because black lives matt...

HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE — A Black Lives Matter protest held at Dartmouth University on Thursday became the subject of controversy after demonstrators went on hate-filled tirades against students studying in the library, The Dartmouth Review reported.

The protest was started to make a statement after a display of Black Lives Matter t-shirts was removed last week. According to one student reporter from The Tab who joined the protest, but then left when things got out of hand, the demonstration started peacefully, until they returned to the library.

Students who were studying and didn\'t join the demonstration were harassed and physically assaulted. According to The Dartmouth Review, protesters yelled things like \"F*** you, you filthy white f***s,\" \"F*** you and your comfort,\" \"F*** you, you racist s***!\" at students in the library.

One student who closed the door of her study space finally fled the library, and was followed by protesters shouting obscenities. According to a report from The Tab, another woman was reduced to tears, while a protester shouted \"F*** your white tears.\"

The Dartmouth Review quoted a social media post from a woman who identified herself as one of the protesters who wrote: \"We raised hell, we caused discomfort, and we made our voices heard all throughout this campus in the name of standing up for our brothers and sisters across the country who are staring terrorism and assault directly in the face.\"
