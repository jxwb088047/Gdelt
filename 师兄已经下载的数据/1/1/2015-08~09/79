Pollster: “Nothing Disqualifies Trump"
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiAugust 26, 2015Leave a Comment
Pollster Frank Luntz has been continuing to conduct focus groups on Donald Trump to see if there is anything the candidate could say that would hurt his poll numbers among supporters. Spoiler alert: there is not. “It’s on his hat.” Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Republican pollster Frank Luntz peered into the GOP’s id by questioning Donald Trump supporters about his appeal — and he found the results terrifying.
“When Trump talks, it may not be presented in a pristine, PC way, but we’ve been having that crap pushed to us for the past 40 years,” said another man. “He’s saying what needs to be said.”
Trump announced his candidacy by slurring Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists — and he has since launched attacks against women, Black Lives Matter protesters and Fox News personalities and has proposed mass deportation and suggested the 14th Amendment is unconstitutional.”*
