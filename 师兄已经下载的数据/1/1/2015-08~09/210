NYT review of David Brock book skims over extensive criticism of NYT - Worldnews.com

 The New York Times today published a typically well-reasoned review of David Brock’s new book, “Killing the Messenger,” which savages the media for overly critical coverage of the Clintons and emphasizes the need for strong responses to attacks from conservative operatives and media outlets. Written by author Hanna Rosin, the review rightly chides Brock for […] ...

Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson and David Brock, a Hillary Clinton surrogate, battled on CNN tonight over what Brock called Trump’s bigoted, sexist, and “really dangerous” rhetoric.

Brock said last night that Trump’s “schlonged” attack on Clinton was about portraying President Obama as “a black rapist.” He didn’t repeat that tonight, but he did go after Trump as a “sad and pathetic” opportunist who’s playing the GOP like a fiddle.

Pierson shot back that Clinton and other liberals whine “like 9-year-old little girls” whenever someone like Trump dares be politically incorrect. Brock said, “Don’t tell me it’s politically correct, it’s just decent.”

Pierson defiantly said Trump is doing well because he isn’t a “soft person” who backs away from attacks from the liberal media....

\"Former MSNBC host Ed Schultz may be at RT now, but this morning he appeared on CNN discussing the 2016 democratic presidential race. Schultz is a huge Sanders fan claiming at one point, “I probably put Bernie Sanders on TV more than anyone else when I was doing a cable show. And I am proud of it.” David Brock is not only a Hillary Clinton supporter but also runs Correct the Record that labels itself as “a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks.”

Schultz dismissed Clinton’s big win saying she is vulnerable in many of the upcoming Super Tuesday states on March 1. “I think Bernie is in a great position right now. It’s not like he’s been rolled in all of these contests. He certainly won New Hampshire. He was expected to lose South Carolina. Seven hundred votes in Nevada. And two-tenths of one percent in and they haven’t even officially called it yet.”

Panelists Michele Bachmann and David Brock discuss Donald Trump’s rise in the polls and Clinton’s reaction to Trump with host Don Lemon. Part 1. Side note, Brock has a new book coming out this week, Killing the Messenger. Bachmann argues the hot topics right now are the Iran deal and illegal immigration, which Donald Trump has come out strongly against. Brock argues what is dominating the Republican primaries is not the issues but Trump’s bullying of other candidates. Lemon asks Brock what he thinks of Clinton firing back at Trump over his sexist attacks against his GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina. In a clip, Clinton said she’s loved to debate Trump. Brock notes the polls are ephemeral and this race is a marathon but the GOP brand has been tremendously damaged by Trump. Bachmann tries to talk about immigration instead of answering questions on Trump’s sexist attacks on Fiorina and Brock calls her out it. Lemon poses the question to Bachmann again. Bachmann: “Well this is an old meme about a war on women…” Lemon rephrases the question on Trump’s war on women, especially with his latest comments on Carly Fiorina’s “face.” Bachmann: “I think like all this kind of stuff is nonsense…people want to have a good life and this is what it’s about.” Lemon moves on and asks Brock about a possible debate between Trump and Clinton. Brock: “Trump is a bully… I think there is no contest…” Bachmann pivots to talking about the Iran deal instead of Trump. Then they discuss the Iran deal and the controversy over Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. L...

\"Morning Joe\" crew confronts David Brock over new Hillary book....
David Brock (born November 2, 1962) is an American journalist and author, the founder of the media group, Media Matters for America, and a Democratic political operative. He was a conservative journalist during the 1990s gaining notoriety for his book The Real Anita Hill and authoring the Troopergate story, which led to Paula Jones filing a lawsuit against Bill Clinton. At the start of the Presidency of George W. Bush his views shifted significantly towards the left. He founded Media Matters for America, a non-profit organization that describes itself as a "progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media."
Brock was born in Washington, D.C., and adopted by Dorothea and Raymond Brock. He has a younger sister, Regina. Brock's family was Catholic and his father held strong conservative beliefs.
Brock grew up in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, where he went to Our Lady of the Assumption School, and later attended Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as a reporter and editor for The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper, sometimes expressing conservative views. He was an intern at The Wall Street Journal. He graduated from Berkeley with a B.A. in history in 1985.
