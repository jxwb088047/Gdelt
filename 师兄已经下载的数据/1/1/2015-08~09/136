Tiger Mosquitos Run Amok Near China-Mongolia Border – chinaSMACK
Staff from Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps near the Mongolian border have described the suffering caused there by Asian Tiger Mosquitos. Kun Qiaxi told China News that the pustules on her 18-month-old son’s head were down to the pest, which arrive every summer for two months. All houses are shut-up and mosquitos nets put up during this period, with people still being bitten despite bearing the heat with long sleeved tops and pants. Shou Hanmin said his tormented pig “committed suicide” by ramming itself into a wall. One netizen said the insects should be let loose on the pig-like corrupt officials.

use spray!
i use it all the time when go outside in summer. coz mosquitos like to bite me so much!
You know, things work better when used from the inside out, why don’t you chug that spray down so it can be twice add effective!
i don’t get it, an article about mosquitos? really?
seriously, if you don’t want to do it anymore just close chinasmack
Imagine 1000 mosquitos biting you day and night, in your sleep, while you eat and even when you’re shitting.
and their Tiger mosquuitos as well worse bite of the lot!!!
If I could I capture them one by one and tear off their proboscis!
Yeah, I’d do what the pig did if I were in his shoes.
I wonder… It humanity focuses all its efforts would we ever be able to eradicate mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, and roaches in the near future?
better if we don’t unless we want to suffer heavy consequences
Sadly enough we need them in our ecosystem, frogs, spiders and …………. need these pests to survive
