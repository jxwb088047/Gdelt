Right Wing Turning Their Hate Toward Jews?
In The Young Turks on YouTube by Aaron WysockiSeptember 23, 2015Leave a Comment
Ted Nugent continues to unravel. He’s been “liking” anti-Jewish internet posts about Israel orchestrating 9/11 lately. Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola (Think Tank), hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
“Musician and conservative activist Ted Nugent liked and responded to a series of comments on his Facebook page that argued that the Israeli government was behind the 9/11 attacks.
The full comment reads: “Israeli Mossad was responsible for the 9/11 attack, why are we still protecting the Zionists who also control our media… Podcasts are fine, but you should have a bigger forum!” (Hat tip to Media Matters’ Timothy Johnson for the find.)”*
