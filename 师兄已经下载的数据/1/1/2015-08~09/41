URUMQI - Top Chinese political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Friday arrived in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, leading a central government delegation to attend festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the region's founding.
He was greeted by local officials and about 1,000 local residents in festive attire at the airport.
The central delegation presented the regional government with souvenirs,including a plaque inscribed with President Xi Jinping's words "building a beautiful Xinjiang, accomplishing the motherland's dream together."
The 69-member delegation will attend a grand celebration on Oct. 1.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was founded on Oct. 1, 1955, after the local legislature elected the first regional government.
On Thursday, the Chinese government released a white paper showcasing the success of regional autonomy in Xinjiang, stressing economic development, religious freedom and ethnic equality in the northwest border region, which accounts for about one sixth of China's territory.
