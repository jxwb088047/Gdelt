Donald Trump and Fox News have an on again, off again relationship. It is currently off again. Now Roger Ailes wants to meet to patch things up. Cenk Uygur, host of the The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"Only a day after Donald Trump announced that he was boycotting Fox News — and after Fox News announced they had cancelled him first — the network has announced that they will enter talks with Trump to discuss his concerns.

Below is the full statement, provided to Mediaite by a Fox News spokesperson:

\'Fox News Chairman & CEO Roger Ailes and Donald Trump spoke this morning and plan to have a meeting next week to discuss their differences of opinion regarding Fox’s coverage of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Ailes will be joined by senior Fox editorial executives. Mr. Trump believes he has been treated unfairly in certain instances. FOX News has held every candidate in this race to the highest journalistic standards throughout our coverage. We believe a candid meeting about our differences is required and that any misunderstandings can be handled without compromising those standards.\'”*

Donald Trump has to keep the most prominent conservative media outlets on his side. The owner of Fox parent company News Corp, Rupert Murdoch, isn’t a fan of Trump, but Fox President Roger Ailes is. Is there a power struggle brewing at Fox? Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

“...Australian media titan Rupert Murdoch is trying as hard as he can to blunt Trump’s meteoric rise to the top of the GOP field. However, the man at the top of Murdoch’s most powerful news organ, Fox News’ Roger Ailes, isn’t interested in blocking Trump’s ascent.

Murdoch has called Trump and his controversial remarks about illegal immigrants an embarrassment to the Republican Party.

However, Gabriel Sherman — author of the Fox News exposéThe Loudest Voice in the Room — wrote at New York magazine that at the conservative news channel, chairman and chief executive Roger Ailes is “pushing Fox to defend Trump’s most outlandish comments...”

Ailes — a former Nixon aide de camp — has reportedly charged certain Fox personalities, like The Five‘s co-host Eric Bolling, with continually backing Trump in on-air discussions.”*

Shortly after Fox News announced the lineup for Thursday night’s GOP debate, Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon that “most likely, I won’t be doing the debate.” He added that he would make a final decision with the network.

“I didn’t like the fact that they sent out press releases, toying, talking about Putin, and playing games. I don’t know what games Roger Ailes is playing,” Trump said. He also accused the network of sending out “wise-guy press releases.”

He was likely referring to a cheeky statement released by a Fox News spokesperson Tuesday, which said:

We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.

 
This comes after the GOP frontrunner expressed his desire to see co-moderator Megyn Kelly barred from the debate, accusing her of not being “fair.”

“He is taken back by the bias he has witnessed on Fox News,” Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson told CNN. She added that the “statement coming out of Fox wasn’t very newsworthy.”

“They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else,” Trump said, claiming that his absence would cost Fox News in the ratings, and threatening to run a simultaneous event in Iowa to raise money for veterans. “Now let’s see how many people watch,” he told reporters, multiple times.

Fox News is finally putting it\'s foot down when it comes to Donald Trump. The GOP front runner took to Twitter, yet again, to publicly call out anchor Megyn Kelly, but the network\'s president wasn\'t having any of it. Roger Ailes issued a lengthy statement castigating Trump — who’s been ranting about Kelly ever since she questioned him at the first big Republican debate of the cycle last month — and demanded an apology. “Donald Trump\'s surprise and unprovoked attack on Megyn Kelly during her show last night is as unacceptable as it is disturbing. Megyn Kelly represents the very best of American journalism and all of us at FOX News Channel reject the crude and irresponsible attempts to suggest otherwise,” Ailes said. “I could not be more proud of Megyn for her professionalism and class in the face of all of Mr. Trump’s verbal assaults,” he said, pledging her his full support.

A flurry of recent stories about Fox News suggests its hosts are obsessed with Donald Trump, but the nation’s top cable news outlet actually has focused less of its attention on the Republican candidate for president than has its competitors. In the five-day period ending late Tuesday, FNC mentioned Trump 496 times compared with 547 for CNN and 620 for MSNBC, according to the media research firm TVEyes. FNC’s coverage of Trump is a hot topic because of a series of negative tweets issued by Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of FNC’s parent company 21st Century Fox. After The New York Times dissected Murdoch’s “feud” with Trump in a front-page story Wednesday, other outlets reported that Murdoch is displeased with FNC’s positive coverage of Trump and has asked FNC chairman and CEO Roger Ailes to dial it back, though observers say such a request is very unlikely given that Murdoch rarely weighs in on editorial decisions at FNC.

The word came in from our best-sourced Fox News Kremlinologists: Fox News had settled for Donald Trump. Roger Ailes had given up on the hapless Marco Rubio. Megyn Kelly was sounding conciliatory, granting that Trump appeared more and more presidential. Rupert Murdoch himself tweeted that the party would be “mad not to unify” around nominee Donald Trump. It worked: Donald Trump arrived, unsuspecting, for his ambush.

Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes and Donald Trump spoke this morning and plan to have a meeting next week to discuss their differences of opinion regarding Fox\'s coverage of Mr. Trump\'s presidential campaign. Ailes will be joined by senior Fox editorial executives. The back and forth between Trump and FNC goes back to GOP frontrunner\'s appearance in the first debate of the 2016 presidential race with Trump and moderator Megyn Kelly sparring over his remarks about women. Though Trump has appeared on FNC series such as Bill O\'Reilly and Sean Hannity in the time since, he has yet to backpedal on his criticism of Kelly.

Roger Eugene Ailes (born May 15, 1940) is president of Fox News Channel, chairman of the Fox Television Stations Group. Ailes was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as well as Rudy Giuliani’s first mayoral campaign in 1989.
Ailes was born and grew up in the factory town of Warren, Ohio, the son of Donna Marie (née Cunningham) and Robert Eugene Ailes, a factory maintenance foreman. Ailes suffers from hemophilia and was often hospitalized as a youth. Ailes attended the Warren city schools. Later, he was inducted into Warren High School's Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. Ailes received a bachelor's degree in 1962 from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.
Ailes' career in television began in Cleveland and Philadelphia, where he started as property assistant (1962) producer (1965) and executive producer (1967–1968) for KYW-TV, for a then-locally produced talk-variety show, The Mike Douglas Show. He later became executive producer for the show, which was syndicated nationally. He was nominated for, but failed to win a Daytime Emmy Awards for it in 1968. It was in this position, in 1967, that he had a spirited discussion about television in politics with one of the show's guests, Richard Nixon, who took the view that television was a gimmick. Later, Nixon called on Ailes to serve as his executive producer of TV. Nixon's election victory was only Ailes's first venture into the political spotlight. His pioneering work in framing national campaign issues and making the stiff Nixon more likeable and accessible to voters was chronicled in The Selling of the President 1968 by Joe McGinniss.
