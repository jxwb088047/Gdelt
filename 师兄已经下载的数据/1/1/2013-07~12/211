Defense chief in China - Global Times
Indian Defense Minister A.K. Antony left New Delhi on Thursday for a four-day official visit to China, overlapping with Pakistani Prime Minister Navaz Sharif's ongoing six-day trip.The high-level Indian delegation also includes the defense secretary and top military commanders, Indian defense ministry spokesman, Sitanshu Kar said on Wednesday. Antony's visit is seen in Beijing as having particular significance as it is the first visit to China by an Indian defense minister in some seven years, the Hindu reported on Thursday.Both Antony and Sharif chose China for their first foreign trip after taking office."That is just a coincidence," Zhao Gancheng, a research fellow on South Asia from the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, told the Global Times Thursday, adding that Antony's visit is mainly focused on increasing mutual military trust between India and China, while Sharif attaches more importance to economic cooperation with China.Sharif met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday and they exchanged ideas about strengthening economic and security cooperation between the two countries.India's Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Wednesday that Antony will have formal delegation-level talks with his Chinese counterpart General Chang Wanquan. The two defense ministers are expected to discuss issues including peace and tranquility along the border, military exchanges, and regional and global security."Last year, then Chinese defense minister Liang Guanglie paid the first visit by a Chinese defense minister in 8 years to India," said Zhao, adding that Antony's visit could be seen as a reciprocal visit to improve military cooperation between the two countries."Before Sharif's election, he vowed to improve the domestic economy and solve the problem of energy shortages," Wang Dehua, head of the Southern and Central Asian Studies Institute of the Shanghai Institute for International Strategic Studies, told the Global Times. "Building the China-Pakistan economic corridor might be the main topic of his talks with Chinese leaders, especially Premier Li Keqiang," said Wang. "In light of recent incidents in Xinjiang, strengthening cooperation with Pakistan on anti-terrorism is an important topic," Wang added."The relations among India, Pakistan and China are complex. However it wouldn't be a problem that Sharif and Antony visit China at the same time," said Zhao."The coincidental arrangement shows China's willingness to develop diplomatic relationships with both countries," Zhao noted.Agencies contributed to this story
