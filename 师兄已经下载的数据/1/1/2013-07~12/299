Goldwind Wins 51MW Wind Turbine Order in Cuba - TES - Today's Energy Solutions
2nd order Goldwind has won in Cuba following an order of 6 units of 750kW wind turbines delivered in 2009.
Goldwind International Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., has signed a 51MW wind turbine supply contract with Energoimport, a subsidiary of Union Electrica (UNE), in Cuba.
 
Under the contract, 34 units of Goldwind’s 1.5MW direct-drive permanent magnet wind turbines will be delivered to Cuba. The Company will also provide additional services including turbine transportation, installation, trial operations, and a 2-year warranty for maintenance. This is the second order Goldwind has won in Cuba following an order of 6 units of 750kW wind turbines delivered in 2009.
 
The La Herradura project is located in the northwest of Las Tunas province and is 700 kilometres from La Habana, Cuba’s capital. The region has a marine climate and is a Class IIA wind speed area with an average speed of approximately 7.5 m/s. Goldwind will provide customised 77/1500 DDPM wind turbines to optimize its operating performance under local conditions.
 
All turbines are expected to be delivered by the end of 2014. The turbine installations are scheduled to be completed by June 2015, while connection to the local electric grid is scheduled to be completed by September 2015. According to our estimates, the power generated by this project will exceed 1% of Cuba’s total generation.
