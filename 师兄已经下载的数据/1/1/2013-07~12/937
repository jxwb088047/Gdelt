The Tiananmen Square car fire is still a mystery, but here's what we know: Shanghaiist
Yesterday afternoon, a car crashed into the main gate at Tiananmen Square and burst into flames. The Beijing police promptly cordoned-off the scene, and Xinhua has been tight-lipped about any details. It's difficult to know what the hell just happened, but here's what we're looking at so far.
The car passengers' identities are still unknown (well, unpublished) but a leaked document revealed that Beijing authorities may be searching for "2 Xinjiang suspects with cars." While that could certainly develop into a key part of this story, it hasn't yet developed further than the leaked memo.
Two reporters from AFP were detained on the scene "with images deleted from their digital equipment", the newswire reported.[...]
By late afternoon the wreckage had been cleared and parts of the square reopened.
Separating the street from the sidewalk are 5-foot-high white steel barricades—designed to prevent the type of attack that took place Monday.
However, the white sport utility vehicle appears to have entered at one of the few openings in the barricades, some 500 yards to the east of the square at the intersection of Nanchizi, a street running perpendicular to the main Chang’an Street. The driver then headed along the sidewalk toward the enormous Mao portrait, which hangs over the vermillion-walled "Gate of Heavenly Peace" (or Tiananmen Gate) that leads into the Forbidden City, erstwhile home of China’s emperors.
