Censorship Vault: Attack in Hotan, Xinjiang - China Digital Times (CDT)
Central Propaganda Department: Do not send journalists to report on the attack in Hotan, Xinjiang. Use only official wire copy. (June 29, 2013)
Censorship Vault features previously untranslated propaganda instructions from the archives of the CDT series Directives from the Ministry of Truth (真理部指令).
CDT has collected the selections we translate here from a variety of sources and has checked them against official Chinese media reports to confirm their implementation.
Since directives are sometimes communicated orally to journalists and editors, who then leak them online, the wording published here may not be exact. The original publication date on CDT Chinese is noted after the directives; the date given may indicate when the directive was leaked, rather than when it was issued. CDT does its utmost to verify dates and wording, but also takes precautions to protect the source.
