Vivian Schiller, president and CEO of NPR, has stepped down following a sting operation by conservative gadfly James O\'Keefe. O\'Keefe\'s group, Veritas, secretly recorded a meeting between men pretending to work for a Muslim charity and NPR executive Ron Schiller (no relation to Vivian). 

In the video, Ron Schiller slammed Tea Party activists: \"Basically, they are, they believe in sort of white, Middle America, gun-toting, I mean, it\'s pretty scary.\"

And Schiller said perhaps the worst thing he could while Congress is debating whether to cut off funds for public broadcasting: \"We would be better off in the long-run without federal funding.\"

Vivian Schiller, who survived an earlier flap over the clumsy firing of commentator Juan Williams, has been leading the charge to protect government funding. But the comments of her fellow executive apparently proved too much, and the NPR board has accepted Vivian Schiller\'s resignation....

\"I will tell you there is not one thing that NBC News, or NPR, or The New York Times or any news organization reports that someone in the audience doesn\'t know more about than we do,\" according to Vivian Schiller, senior vice president and chief digital officer at NBC News. In this relaxed, candid morning lecture conversation, NPR\'s media correspondent David Folkenflik interviews Schiller, about the current role of social media in the context of the larger media. Are these new capabilities creating pressure cookers of instantaneous public outrage, or can they be open forums for criticism and exploring ideas? The answer is complex, like the question, but valid -- a little bit of both.

Vivian Luisa Schiller (born September 13, 1961) is the former president and CEO of National Public Radio.
Schiller is the daughter of Ronald Schiller, a former editor at Reader's Digest, and Lillian Schiller of Larchmont, New York. She graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor's degree in Russian studies and Soviet studies, and a Master's degree in Russian from Middlebury College.
Prior to leading NPR, Schiller was a senior vice president of NYTimes.com. She was the first general manager of Discovery Times Channel (now Investigation Discovery), from 2002 - 2006.
In June 2011, Schiller joined NBC News as the chief digital officer.
On October 20, 2010, NPR fired political analyst Juan Williams. Initial reports indicated Williams was fired for his comments on Fox News that he gets "nervous" when he sees people in "Muslim garb" boarding a plane. Speaking to the media, Schiller stated Williams was not fired for that particular incident, but for offering his controversial opinions on several occasions, which she deemed a breach of journalistic ethics for an NPR analyst.
