One Killed, Eight Injured In China Explosions
One person was killed and eight were injured in a series of explosions outside the local office of China's Communist Party in the northern Shanxi province on Wednesday morning, state media reported.
The blasts occurred in front of the party office in the provincial capital Taiyuan around 7:40 a.m.
According to the Xinhua news agency, eight explosions were heard as the "self-made bombs" went off. Police found steel bearings, circuit boards and similar explosive materials at the scene, it said.
A bomb disposal squad was sent to the spot. Traffic at the site was resumed later as police began an investigation into the incident, the news agency said.
Tensions are high in China in the wake of last week's car crash in capital Beijing's Tiananmen Square which the authorities said was a terrorist attack. All the three occupants of a jeep and two tourists were killed when the vehicle ploughed into a crowd at the square and caught fire. Authorities blamed Uighur Muslim extremists from the restive Xinjiang region for the incident.
