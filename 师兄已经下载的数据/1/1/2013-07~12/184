Three Uighur Chinese nationals held in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility were released, the Pentagon announced Tuesday.
The three, Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik, and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper, were the last of the Uighur Chinese nationals in the facility following a 2008 District of Columbia Court Order requiring their release.
“This transfer and resettlement constitutes a significant milestone in our effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,” Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.
The three were voluntarily released to the government of Slovakia.
