A man suspected of killing a woman and injuring her daughter 18 years ago in central China was arrested earlier this month in remote Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, local police said on Thursday.
Zhong Zhibin, 43, was detained in Xinjiang's Aksu Prefecture in northwest China on Dec. 20 by police from central Hubei Province, and was transferred back on Tuesday to Hubei's Jingmen City, where the murder occurred.
Zhong told police that he had a conflict with a man surnamed Zou while peddling fish in Jingmen 18 years ago. He then decided to kill his wife and daughter as a revenge.
He also said that he never had a moment of peace over the years and knew he would one day be arrested.
