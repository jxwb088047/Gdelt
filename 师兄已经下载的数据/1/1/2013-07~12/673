The Tiananmen terror attack has been widely criticized across the country. CCTV reporter Guan Yang spoke to residents in Urumqi city in China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where people expressed their condemnation.
"I got the news of the car crash from the newspaper, I felt angry towards these terrorists who are posting threats on social stability in the country. A harmonious society should be one of stability and peace. " Said Arman, Urumqi, Xinjing.
"The violent terrorist attack is done by a handful of extremists in Xinjiang, the evil minds behind such activities doesn’t reflect on other ethnic groups in any way. The majority of people here do value the vitality of ethnic unity. " Xi Lan, Urumqi, Xinjiang, said.
Adilijiang, Urumqi, Xinjiang, said, "Such a violent terrorist attack shouldn’t happen in a city like Beijing, the capital of an influential nation. The negative effects brought by the incident are not just on people from Xinjiang; no government in the world should tolerate terrorist acts that jeopardize public life and property. There must be other civilized ways of defining one’s opinions and objections rather than killing innocent people."
