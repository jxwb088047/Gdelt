Washington's shameful response to terror |From the Press |chinadaily.com.cn
Terrorism in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region should be condemned by the US government, says an article in People's Daily (excerpts below).
What if such an incident happened in the United States? How would Washington respond then?
Some US officials called the brutal terrorist attacks on June 26 in Shanshan county, Xinjiang "the beginning of democratic movements in China".
The US State Department spokesman even criticized the government's policies on ethnic minorities.
Some Xinjiang separatists living in the US seem ready to commit more atrocities.
As a victim of terrorism, the US should condemn and fight terrorism together with the international community.
China always takes a clear-cut and unambiguous stand on terrorists attacking the US and expresses its genuine and heart-felt sympathy. But the US response to China under similar circumstances disappoints the Chinese people.
The US government's duplicity and "double standards" are evident in its words and deeds. Some politicians' prejudice toward China's policies on ethnic groups is ingrained.
They are blind to the development and people's will of Xinjiang.
China will fight against the separatists, terrorists and extremists in Xinjiang with resolute and powerful measures to protect people and property. Portraying murderers as heroes of democracy is a blasphemy of democracy.
