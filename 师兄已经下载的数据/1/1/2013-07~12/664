Chinese Police Hunt For Suspects Behind Tiananmen Square Car Crash
Police in the Chinese capital Beijing are hunting for two suspects from the country's restive Xinjiang region for what is believed to be a suicide attack on the Tiananmen Square that left five people dead.
In what appears to be a daring attack at China's seat of power, a jeep ploughed into tourists at the Square before exploding into flames. Three occupants of the vehicle and as many as 38 people, mostly tourists and security officers, were injured in Monday's incident.
Tiananmen Square was the scene of the 1989 pro-democracy protests which were crushed by the military. The site is generally kept under tight security because of its proximity to key political institutions.
The authorities are now hunting two Uighur suspects, according to a notice circulated to Beijing hotels. "There was a major criminal case in the city. To prevent the suspects and their vehicles from committing more crimes, now we require all hotels to report guests who have registered since October 1 and the cars they have driven," the notice said, and named two men who it said had been involved in several "serious crimes."
The two men named in the notice reportedly come from Piqan county, where an attack on the local government offices and police stations in June had left 24 people dead and 21 injured, according to state media.
The Uighurs, a Turkic speaking Muslim ethnic minority from China's far western region of Xinjiang, are often complain about discrimination and the government's repressive policies. The region has seen several riots in the past in which more than 300 people had been killed during the last four years. At least a dozen of Uighurs arrested in connection with the violence had been executed by the authorities.
