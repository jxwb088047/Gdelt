China Internet Crackdown Snares Uighur Users | TIME.com
An anti-terrorism force including public security police and the armed police attend an anti-terrorism joint exercise in Hami, northwest China's Xinjiang region on July 2, 2013.
July and August produced a surge of arrests in China’s restive Xinjiang province, as authorities clamped down on what the state-run China Daily called “religious extremist content on the Internet.”
A total of 139 people were arrested for allegedly posting or sharing jihadist sentiments online.
Dilshat Rexit, a spokesman for the overseas-based World Uyghur Congress, claims that the government’s aim is to “suppress Uighurs’ use of the Internet to obtain information and express different points of view.” Beijing has previously complained of separatist Uighurs fighting in the Syrian war and returning to Xinjiang to put their military experience into practice.
Chinese government  crackdown the Uighur or Tibetan???? Non-sense!!!!  For an easy example for you to understand why I said the rumors are all nonsense. The students of all minority including the two mentioned above can get the enrollment of good universities under lower grades than Han Nationality. Do you know how many students study so hard, try to get the enrollment???
China is getting a taste of its own medicine! For years, China has turned a blind eye to Islamic Militants creating havoc in Pakistan,Afghanistan,Iraq etc and now their own Muslims are being accused of terrorism! Unless the whole world acts in unison, it will be hard to deal with this problem. Many reasonable people in Islamic Countries are equally concerned about the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism. China must be seen to be on the right side
