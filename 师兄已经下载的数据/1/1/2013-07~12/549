URUMQI — Singapore plays a “very important role” in the international arena, particularly in coordinating relations between big countries, including for China-United States ties, said Xinjiang Party Secretary Zhang Chunxian yesterday.
Speaking at a meeting before a dinner he hosted for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Singapore delegation — who are mid-way through a week-long official visit to China, Mr Zhang noted that relationships between big countries have an important bearing on the world.
He “personally endorsed” Singapore for using its strengths, including multilingualism, in coordinating these relations and said he hoped that the Republic will continue playing this role.
Mr Zhang, who was elected to the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo last year, is widely seen as a Chinese leader to watch for in the future.
He cited how Singapore had played a very positive role in persuading some states within the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN), which were concerned about trade deficits, to agree to the penning of a free trade agreement between the grouping and China years ago.
Mr Zhang also noted that both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang were “very happy” with the outcome of the talks they held with Mr Lee on Monday.
In response, Mr Lee said Singapore was a very small country and so had an interest “in a stable and prosperous region and a China developing and connecting with ASEAN and the world”.
He added that Singapore would like to continue its “modest influence” towards such an outcome, which will be in the interest of China, the region and the world.
Mr Zhang also said he had a “very good impression” of Mr Lee’s administration and how measures had been rolled out to adapt to the changing conditions and ensured Singapore’s stability, growth and ability to attract talent.
He went on to praise Mr Lee’s wife, Ms Ho Ching, for having her own standing in the world through her leadership of Temasek Holdings, which he described as “top class” among the world’s sovereign wealth funds.
Mr Zhang also expressed his hope for greater economic links between Xinjiang and Singapore. Citing how trade volume, though quite small, has jumped very sharply recently — it grew 200 per cent last year and 120 per cent in the first half of this year — he said there were bright prospects for greater further collaboration.
Yesterday, Mr Lee learnt about the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps — the earliest members were from the People’s Liberation Army who had been sent to defend and develop China’s frontier cities since 1954 — during a tour of the Shihezi Army Reclamation Museum.
He had a chat with the corps’ Political Commissar Che Jun about their development plans before visiting the Xinjiang Tianye Group, a state-owned enterprise that is among China’s top 500 manufacturing companies.
