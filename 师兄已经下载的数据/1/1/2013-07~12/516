Terrorists sentenced to death - Global Times
A local court in Kashi, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Monday handed out death penalties to two terrorists who led terrorist attacks that killed 15 police officers and community workers in late April.The Intermediate People's Court of Kashi Monday held an open trial for the attacks in Bachu county, according to a report from local news portal ts.cn.The court sentenced Musa Hesen to death for organizing and leading a terrorist group, the illegal manufacture of explosives as well as intentional homicide, and handed down a death sentence to Rahman Upur for joining a terrorist group and intentional homicide.Another three men, who were part of the terrorist group, were handed down jail terms of between nine years and life imprisonment.The court said the defendants were given the right to use their indigenous language throughout the trial and had access to lawyers.According to the court, since March 2008, the five men and another terrorist, Kasimu Memet, had promoted illegal religious activities and religious extremist ideas, watched and listened to videos and audios from overseas terrorist groups, and printed a large number of books promoting religious extremism and terrorist ideas.The group also prepared knives, flags and signs to plan for terrorist attacks and purchased a large sum of raw materials for building explosives. It was revealed that they built 10 explosive devices and carried out bomb tests.On March 8, 2013, Memet and Hesen established a terrorist group. The two men and members of the group performed illegal religious activities, carried out training for terrorist attacks, built explosives, and filmed the whole process.On the noon of April 23, several police officers and community workers in Serikbuya town, Bachu county found suspicious personnel and devices in a residence on a regular visit, and reported the situation to the local police station.After being notified of the visit, Memet and Hesen led members of their group to the residence, attacking police officers and community workers with knives. After killing three female community workers, they cornered nine police officers and community workers in a room and then set a fire, burning them to death.The terrorists stabbed to death another two police officers and a local official, smashed three vehicles, and set fire to the local police station.Memet and another five terrorists were shot dead by police during the attacks.The five men on trial confessed to the crimes listed above during the hearing.Li Wei, an anti-terrorism expert with the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday that the death sentence handed down to the main culprits was consistent with related laws."Upholding laws during our fight against terrorism helps people at home and abroad get a clearer understanding about terrorist threats in Xinjiang," Li said.Xinjiang has witnessed a number of terrorist attacks in recent years due to separatists' attempts to disrupt social order in the region.In addition to the April attack in Kashi, violence on June 26 killed 35 people, including 11 attackers, in the township of Lukqun, Turpan. It was followed by two riots in Hotan on June 28, though no casualties were reported.Turgunjan Tursun, a research fellow with the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the violence is neither an ethnic, religious nor political issue."No matter what banner [the terrorists carry] or slogan [they use], violent attacks are against the law. We must punish the crime in accordance with the law, and the sentence [on Monday] was a demonstration of that," said Tursun.
