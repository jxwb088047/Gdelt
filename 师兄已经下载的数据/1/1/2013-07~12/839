Two policemen and nine suspected Islamist militants were killed in a clash when rebels attacked a police station in the Uyghur-majority Xinjiang province of northwest China today.
Nine axe-wielding assailants were shot dead during an attack on a police station in China's restive Xinjiang province, state media reported Saturday.
The attackers killed two auxiliary police officers before they were themselves gunned down, according to the Xinhua news agency.
Quoting police, Xinhua said the attackers armed themselves with knives and axes and that two police officers were also injured alongside the two that were killed. The agency gave no further details.
The assault comes at a time of heightened tension within Xinjiang following a fiery attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last month which the government blamed on "terrorists" from the province backed by international Islamist militants.
Beijing blamed the attack on Uighur separatists backed by the violent Islamist militant East Turkestan Islamic Movement.
Xinjiang - a vast, resource rich province that makes up much of China's western flank - has been the scene of several violent clashes, the most recent of which left dozens dead in April, June and August this year.
Ethnic Uighurs, a mainly Muslim minority who make up a majority in Xinjiang, routinely complain of rights abuses against them by the authorities.
