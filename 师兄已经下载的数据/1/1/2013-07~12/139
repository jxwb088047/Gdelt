Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will be on a week-long official tour of China beginning Sunday at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
This will be Lee’s first visit to China after the new leadership assumed office. Lee is also expected to call on President Xi Jinping. Premier Li Keqiang will meet Lee at lunch at the Great Hall of the People. Lee will also visit China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province.
Former Chinese ambassador to Singapore Zhang Xiaokang said deliberations on how to expand the trade relations between the two nations would be one of the major agenda points during Lee’s visit. He also said that among the ASEAN countries, Singapore was the only one that had signed a Free Trade Agreement with China. China is now the third largest trading parter of Singapore.
"Among all the ASEAN countries, Singapore is the last country to establish diplomatic ties with China. Yet the cooperation between the two sides is the closest. And both are trying to carry out broader and deeper cooperation. That’s why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is visiting China. He wants to communicate with Chinese leaders and decide which areas could see more cooperation. The two sides will discuss issues like upgrading obsolete machinery in industrial parks in Liaoning and Xinjiang." Zhang Xiaokang, Former Chinese Ambassasor to Singapore said.
