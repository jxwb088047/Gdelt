Turkish and Uyghur religious leaders discuss education | General | Worldbulletin News
Head of Turkish Religious Affairs Mehmet Gormez met on Monday with Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Director-General of Religious Affairs Vey Xin Hui in China.
As the two officials talked about religious education and services, Gormez pointed out that the modern world currently faces the problem of bringing different religions, languages, ethnicities, and cultures together in unity and peace.
"The more freely people can practise their religion, the easier it will become to live together," Gormez said, focusing on the importance of religious education.
He will continue a series of meetings on Tuesday in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China, and is expected to later arrive in capital Beijing.
