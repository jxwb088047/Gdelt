Military official urges resolute fights against terrorism- China.org.cn
A senior military official has urged armed forces in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to resolutely combat terrorism and safeguard stability in Xinjiang.
Fan Changlong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), made the remarks during an inspection tour to the armed forces in Xinjiang.
Fan asked the armed police to tighten security measures in crucial areas, intensify patrols, and keep high alert to cope with emergencies.
He said to steadfastly maintain ethnic unity and social stability in Xinjiang is the obligatory responsibility of the armed forces.
"We must unswervingly fight against terrorists and the 'three forces' of terrorism, extremism and separatism, in order to safeguard ethnic unity," Fan added.
Rioters killed 24 police officers and civilians and injured 21 others in a violent terrorist attack in Xinjiang's Lukqun Township on June 26.
