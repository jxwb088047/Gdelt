Hotel: Chinese police search for Uighur suspects after deadly car attack at Forbidden City - Yahoo News
BEIJING, China - A hotel employee says police investigating the apparent car attack at Beijing's Forbidden City are searching for information on two ethnic Uighur minority suspects.
The vehicle plowed through a crowd and crashed Monday at Tiananmen Gate, killing five people and injuring 38. It was not immediately clear if the two suspects were among the three people killed inside the vehicle. Two bystanders, including a Filipino woman, also were killed.
Zhao Fuzhou, a security official at Beijing's Xinjiang Dasha hotel, said Tuesday police had circulated a notice to hotels searching for information about two suspects with Uighur names.
Radicals among the Muslim Turkic Uighurs have been fighting a low-intensity insurgency against Chinese rule for years.
