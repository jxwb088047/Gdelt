Marianas Variety - Suit against former Palau president and VP to continue
NGERULMUD, Palau (Oceania TV News) — Associate Justice Kathleen Salii has granted a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit against Palau’s two former top officials.
The case was filed in 2012 against former President Johnson Toribiong and former Vice President Kerai Mariur in their official and personal capacity over the misuse of Uighurs funds and unconstitutional executive branch over-expenditures.

Rachel Dimitruk, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said the court only dismissed the case in the defendants’ official capacity, but will continue on in their personal capacity.
Then-senator and now President Tommy Remengesau Jr., Sens. Surangel Whipps Jr., Raynold Oilouch, Hokkons Baules and Elias Camsek Chin sued Toribiong and Vice Mariur on accusations that U.S. government money for Uighur refugees was misspent or inappropriately diverted to the then-president’s family.
At the time, the senators urged the Attorney General’s Office to file the suit, but the AG did not, prompting the senators to hire a private counsel and file the lawsuit themselves.
