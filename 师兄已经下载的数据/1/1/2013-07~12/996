China’s foreign minister linked outside terrorists to recent violence in western Xinjiang region, as the country ordered around-the-clock paramilitary patrols to deter further unrest.
“This is a deliberately violent terrorist incident linked up with overseas terrorist forces that has brought serious harm to local peoples,” Wang Yi said of recent violence as he met with his Turkish counterpart yesterday in Brunei. Unrest on July 26 in Lukqun township killed at least 35 people.
China ordered paramilitary troops to patrol around the clock in Xinjiang before the fourth anniversary of clashes between Uighurs and Han Chinese in the regional capital Urumqi that killed 200 people. Yu Zhengsheng, the member of the Politburo Standing Committee in charge of Tibet and Xinjiang, vowed during a June 29 meeting in Urumqi to “strike hard” against attacks, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Wang said there had been “cases of a minority of criminals planning violent terrorist attacks.”
China has previously linked violence to religious extremists whose ringleaders were trained in Pakistan at camps run by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group it says seeks independence for Xinjiang. Citing anti-terrorism officials it didn’t identity, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported yesterday that some members of the East Turkestan movement had gone to Syria, where they fought with the opposition.
While about 90 percent of China is ethnic Han, more than 40 percent of Xinjiang’s 22 million people are Uighurs. Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress, said the recent violence has nothing to do with terrorism.
“The alleged purpose is to seek a political pretext for the repression of the Uighur people,” he said in an e-mailed statement. “The reasons for Uighurs protesting is very clear. They want the right to political decision-making and to control the economy.”
Nineteen people in Xinjiang have been detained for spreading rumors online and via their mobile phones about the recent violence, according to Tianshan Net, the official news website of Xinjiang’s local government.
