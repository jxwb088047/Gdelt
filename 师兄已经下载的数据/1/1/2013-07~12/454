The Xinjiang People's Government and the People's Insurance Company (Group) of China signed cooperative agreements at the distribution ceremony of the Health Express for Mothers mobile clinics in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on September 10, 2013, aiming to improve the service quality and level of the project and benefit more women. 

Twenty mobile clinics worth 2.4 million yuan (US$ 392,160) will travel to 20 counties and municipalities in Xinjiang to provide healthcare services to rural women and children. 

Secretary General of the China Women's Development Foundation (CWDF) Qin Guoying says that she hopes women’s federations will carry out their full responsibilities in implementing the project, to ensure its sustainable development. 

The CWDF representatives will visit Jimusaer County and Qitai County in the region’s Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture to assess the project’s implementation there. 

The CWDF launched the Health Express for Mothers charity project in Xinjiang in 2005. It has donated 133 mobile clinics to Xinjiang, which have covered 88 counties, municipalities and districts. By June 2013, the program had provided free medical counseling for about 2.4 million people in Xinjiang, health checkups to about 1.4 million people, knowledge training to about 0.4 million people, aid to 24,122 pregnant and lying-in women and cared for 2,829 terminal patients.
