8 police station 'attackers' gunned down in Xinjiang - The China Post
One of the attackers was held in the clash in Shache county, said the official website of the government of Xinjiang, where mainly Muslim Uyghurs are the largest ethnic group.
The website, which called it a "terrorist attack" said: "Police took decisive action, shooting eight people and arresting one." Officials were investigating, it added.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang called it a "violent terrorist attack."
"It testifies once again to the anti-society and anti-human nature of the three evil forces, and they have caused great damage to the state, the society and the people," he said at a regular briefing.
Beijing refers to what it calls ethnic separatism, religious extremism and terrorism as the "three evil forces."
