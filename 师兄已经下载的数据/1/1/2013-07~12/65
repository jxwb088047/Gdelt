"The scale of electoral fraud is so large that it cannot dismissed by officials, like Ramiz Mehdiyev, whose name featured prominently in the sale of parliamentary seats 

BAKU. October 24, 2013: Ramiz Mehdiyev, Chief of the President Administration, created an international scandal by accusing the U.S. government of being complicit with the Azerbaijani government in forging the results of the presidential elections of October 9, 2013. Mr. Mehdiyev’s statement was accompanied by a statement from the Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev, who threatened to disclose the audio-recording of his conversation with the U.S. Ambassador Richard Morningstar after the US State Department refuted the allegations that the US Ambassador had made statements of support for Ilham Aliyev’s victory at the presidential elections. The Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev is no longer represented in president Ilham Aliyev’s cabinet, but Ramiz Mehdiyev is still heading the Presidential Administration, and as one may assume, stands by his statements.
The presidential candidate from the opposition National Council of Democratic Forces Jamil Hasanli comments on Chief of the President Administration statement regarding the US involvement in Azerbaijan’s presidential elections:
Mr. Hasanli, after the statements made by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, U.S. State Department, as well as other influential organizations on illegitimacy of elections on October 9, even the government's chief ideologist Ramiz Mehdiyev began to speak out. In your opinion, what caused his sudden appearance on political stage after the election?
I am familiar with the interview and my first impression is that he is either unaware about the total election fraud, or that his “philosophical approach” to politics in Azerbaijan is nothing but a modern packaging of the old communist way of thinking. “AppGate" incident revealed that the results were announced one day before and whole world started discussing this shame. They are still shamelessly dared to show it as a democracy-dressed election. Azerbaijani government has adapted to election fraud at the same level as it has adapted to corruption and bribery. It has prevented the people, the main source of the government, from forming their own government. On October 9, there was an outright seizure of power in Azerbaijan. This is the most serious crime committed against the people of Azerbaijan according to the laws of the land.
I do not share Ramiz Mehdiyev’s opinions. The harsh accusations against the OSCE and the US reflects not only Mehdiyev’s opinion, but the position of the entire government of Azerbaijan and Ilham Aliyev in the first place, since he declared himself a winner in the rigged elections.
Another important point is that the Azerbaijani government made a serious mistake when it allowed Ramiz Mehdiyev to speak on behalf of this government while his name appeared in a widely publicized international scandal regarding the selling of the parliamentary seats in Azerbaijan. In fact, the Azerbaijani government prior decision was to keep Ramiz Mehdiyev out of October 9 elections, due to the scandal with selling the parliamentary seats, after that scandal prominently featured in the international agenda and was even included in U.S. State Department's annual report and the Council of Europe reports.
Keeping Ramiz Mehdiyev outside this process lost its meaning after he turned himself into a spokesperson for the Azerbaijani government by defending the results of rigged elections, blackmailing the US and OSCE. Thus, the “parliament seats seller” demonstrated his importance to Ilham Aliyev’s regime. All these statement serves the purpose of scaring the Azerbaijani people and teaching the West a lesson. It would be naïve to think that these useless manoeuvres would yield any results. The nature of this regime is known to everyone and it is clear to everyone that this government will fall. Ramiz Mehdiyev and his team are not the future but the past of Azerbaijan that sunk in filth. The future of the country was revealed on October 9.
Mehdyev claims that they have been informed about the OSCE observation mission’s report on October 10 a few days before it was announced. What is the bases of this Nostradamus-style statement?
Probably, it is true. Because the Azerbaijani government, including Mehdiyev, has given the green light to election fraud a few days before October 9 elections, and by ignoring everything, instructed the local authorities, Central Election Commission, local election constituencies to make Ilham Aliyev a winner no matter what the price may be. The "Appgate” scandal which hit the world media was a bright example of it. Bysuch actions, the Azerbaijani government proved the lack of legitimacy for the elections and turned Azerbaijan’s name into a symbol of shame in the world.
Now, instead of feeling ashamed of this incident they still speak about "democratic elections”. They do not understand that the third- term presidency of Ilham Aliyev is anti -constitutional and dressing it to look like democratic elections will not change anything. During the election campaign, we have repeatedly appealed to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to have the presidential candidate to disclose their sources of income, the value of their properties and its sources, which is the requirement of the Azerbaijani Election Code. Maybe Mr. Mehdiyev can comment on why the Central Election Commission has not fulfilled this requirement of law? This fact alone is sufficient to invalidate the election results.
Mehdiyev argues that the presidential 2013 elections is a big step forward in a democratic development and the establishment of the rule of law, free society…
The person who is involved in the selling the parliamentary seats and is taking part in the process of usurping the power has neither any sense of responsibility, nor any normal perception of such concepts as free society or rule of law. There is only one thing in Ramiz Mehdiyev’s mind: How to use the current situation in order to strengthen his own position in the Azerbaijani government and his interview is an indication of this thought process. Another point is that the scale of the election fraud is too big to be whitewashed by Rami Mehdiyev’s statements. If to pay attention to the trends in the Azerbaijani elections over the past years, one can see that with every next elections there is an increased authoritarianism which in turn increases the scale of the election fraud.
If in 2008 ballot box stuffing and other serious election violations monitored by the international election observers of the OSCE was at 23%, in 2010 parliamentary elections it was 32%, and on October 9, 2013 presidential elections it has increased to 58% and the elections were assessed as bad or very bad in the majority of the local election precincts.
What does this mean? This means that in more than half of the constituencies, the elections have been rigged. There is no doubt that the facts included in the report of the OSCE observation mission of course, does not capture all cases of election frauds and election violations. Neither the OSCE /ODIHR’s Warsaw office, nor the famous description of Azerbaijan’s election frauds by Cenk Uygur, the CBC presenter, can explain the election fraud in our country. And there is no need to think hard to find the election fraud, just looking at the official website of the CEC would suffice to see the picture.
For instance, at 38 polling station of 81 Beylegan Elections Constituency, 323 of the 705 voters voted inside the voting room, whereas 382 of them voted outside the polling station. At 39th and 40th polling stations of the same constituency, similar results have been observed. At 1st polling station 240 out of 990 voting papers have been marked in the voting room, 750 of them outside as in favor of Ilham Aliyev. Accordingly, at 2nd polling station, 483 citizens voted inside, 486 voters voted outside and all voting papers marked in favour of Ilham Aliyev. These facts are gathered just three polling stations of one election constituency. How come that the number of disabled persons (who can vote outside the polling stations in accordance with the Election Code) is three times more than the number of the healthy citizens-voters? How can Mehdiyev, the great thinker of our days, explain this anomaly?
Or this - government must admit that 75 per cent of the population has become disabled, either it has a mental disability. In fact, the results conducted from the 39th polling station of the 81st Beylegan elections constituency gives us the real picture of the October 9 elections. The fact that 240 out of 990 voters voted in the polling station, accurately depicts voter turnout in the country.
In the absence of 40 per cent of voters in the country (due to large numbers of emigration in Azerbaijan – ed.), how can the government declare 72 percent voter turnout? In Nakhchivan 40 per cent of the registered voters are simply not living in Nakhchivan anymore, but the official election results indicate a 83-percent turnout.
You speak about the election fraud but Mehdiyev claims that the opposition has not showed a single fake voting ballot. What would be your response to this claim?
It seems that Mehdiyev is unaware that hundreds of sealed voting papers filed in favour of Ilham Aliyev has been shown to the media at my press-conference held on October 10 at 11:00 AM. Moreover, on October 11 the Euronews TV channel has aired a program showing the forged election ballots over 20 times.
Our observers collected at the polling stations papers reflecting up to of 2000 incidents of election fraud, and they have been submitted to our authorized representative Gulaga Aslanli. While he was on his way taking these papers to the CEC, he was detained by the Binagadi District Police Department at the orders of the Azerbaijani government. He was released from the police department only after the CEC meeting on election violations was over. It seems that for Mehdiyev "transparent and free elections" begins from the police department.
The most striking point in Ramiz Mehdiyev’s interview is, of course, his claim that the U.S. government "proposed" that the Azerbaijani government gave 25 per cent of votes to the candidate of the National Council and give the rest of 74-75 per cent of the votes to Ilham Aliyev. The United States has denied Mehdiyev’s claim. But it is interesting, why Mehdiyev lies on this issue?
I have always said, and I repeat that the people who seized the power ignore the exclusive right of the people to form a government of their own choosing. The government neglects people’s constitutional rights and claims having discussed the issues of seizing the power with the representatives of foreign countries. Ramiz Mehdiyev must explain that why, prior to the presidential elections, he discussed the presidential elections, voting issues and voting percentage which are the constitutional right of the people, with the representatives of foreign countries. Such negotiations are carried out by the Azerbaijani authorities to serve the seizure of power by Ilham Aliyev and according to the country’s constitution, this is the most serious crime committed against the Azerbaijani people. The Azerbaijani government should be held accountable for this crime. Precisely because of such actions by the Azerbaijani government, Ilham Aliyev should step down and he will! (Azeri Report).
