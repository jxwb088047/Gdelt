BAKU - As abruptly as Russia began its military campaign in Syria nearly six months ago, President Putin has ordered the withdrawal of Russian military forces from the country. The President announced that the Russian military had accomplished their mission in Syria and that the estimated 3.000 to 6.000 Russian troops are to withdraw from the country. The process will take about 5 months. 

However, Putin is not completely abandoning al-Assad. The S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a number of military advisers and as many as two battalions or about 800 servicemen will remain in Syria, spread over two locations. Meaning, Russian forces will remain operational in the Bassel al-Assad air base in Latakia and the naval facility in Tartus. 

This unexpected move has many wondering why. Especially since for months, the Russian forces, backed by warplanes, missiles, and artillery pieces, have bolstered the al-Assad government. The opposition forces have been pushed back, and ISIS is weaker than it was a few months ago. Russia, together with Iran, have turned around the Syrian battlespace. For the first time, in a long time, al-Assad is gaining the upper hand. However, the rebel forces are not yet defeated, and a Russian withdrawal means a setback for al-Assad. So how does Putin’s withdrawal from Syria fit in the geopolitical grand design of Russia?

In this video Luke Rudkowski goes over all the details of Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing the withdrawal of Russian forces inside of Syria and the real reason why this is happening right now. It looks like tensions in the middle east are dying down with the face off between the U.S and Russia but on the other side of the world they are heating up. We talk about the geopolitical chess moves that are being made and how things will develop.

The Syrian Arab Army’s “Tiger Forces” and their allies have restored security to this strategic city after a violent battle with the terrorists that occupied this desert area in northern Syria. According to the media coordinator for Liwaa Al-Quds (Jerusalem Brigade), the Syrian Armed Forces liberated Khanasser this morning after breaking through ISIS’ defenses at the southern perimeter of the city yesterday afternoon.

After four-plus years of fighting, Syria\'s war has killed at least 250,000 people and displaced 12 million people. And, though it started as a civil war, it\'s become much more than that. It\'s a proxy war that has divided much of the Middle East, and has drawn in both Russia and the United States. To understand how Syria got to this place, it helps to start at the beginning and watch it unfold:

The Russian military has declared mission accomplished in Syria. They say they will begin moving their forces out of the country tomorrow. Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola (ThinkTank), Jimmy Dore, and Wes Clark Jr., hosts of the The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

\"On Monday, the same day Syria peace talks resumed in Geneva, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a surprising announcement: He would begin immediatelywithdrawing the \"main\" Russian forces from Syria, almost six months after he first intervened in the war.

To state the obvious, we should wait and see the degree to which Putin honors his word. Russia has sent large troop deployments into eastern Ukraine, which it denies, and its Syria intervention has heavily bombed non-ISIS rebels despite claims of targeting only extremists. So cautious skepticism is merited.

Still, there is real reason to suspect that Putin could be sincere — and that his withdrawal could be a positive step toward ending the Syrian conflict that has become the worst war of the 21st century.”*
