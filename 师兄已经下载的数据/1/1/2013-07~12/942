Three groups active in Xinjiang banned - Pakistan - DAWN.COM
ISLAMABAD: The government of Pakistan has accepted a Chinese demand to proscribe three extremist organisations which are said to be active in the north-western region of Xinjiang.
According to BBCUrdu.com, the three organisations — East Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Islamic Jihad Union — have been put on the list of proscribed militant organisations after reports that their members were planning terrorist activities in the region and inciting people against the Chinese government. — Monitoring Desk
I am not sure we should concede to such demands even though China is our close ally. The banned groups are fellow Muslims and there is hardly any doubt that the Muslims of what China calls Xinjiang are being subjected to severe persecution.
