As Chinese President Xi Jinping was preparing to make a landmark visit earlier this month to Central Asia, police gunned down 22 ethnic minority Muslim Uyghurs in what they called an "anti-terrorism" operation in China's restive northwestern Xinjiang region. And four days after Xi returned to Beijing last week following his whirlwind Central Asian tour, reports emerged that police had conducted a separate raid on a "terrorist" training camp and munitions center in Xinjiang, killing a dozen Uyghurs and wounding 20 others.Increasing tensions in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and fears of trouble in the neighborhood with the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces from Afghanistan next year may have dogged Xi as he went on his Central Asian trip from Sept. 3-13.Xinjiang, the largest Chinese administrative region, shares vast borders with five Muslim countries—Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as Central Asian states Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.Xi visited Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and two other Central Asian states, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, bagging tens of billions of dollars worth of energy deals and investments during his 10-day trip in what one analyst said was an extremely rare feat by a leader of a major power.By boosting energy-based investments in the region, Beijing will get vast amounts of oil and gas to power its rapid economic growth but also strengthen ties with governments and influence them not to support Uyghur groups fighting for greater political, economic, and religious rights in Xinjiang, experts say.  "China wants a stable backyard," Johannes Linn, a former World Bank vice president for Europe and Central Asia, told RFA, characterizing Beijing's Central Asia strategy as one driven by economics, energy security, and broader security concerns in the region.He said that it was not in Chinese interests to see Central Asian nations plunge into civil war, be gripped by localized conflicts, or be troubled by any spillover of terrorist activities from Afghanistan.In addition, Beijing is equally worried that minority Uyghur communities in Central Asian states may fuel anti-establishment campaigns in the troubled Xinjiang region."Any kind of support from what could be Uyghur minorities in border areas in their neighboring Central Asian countries in their own territory would obviously not be welcomed," Linn said.He cited as an example Kyrgyzstan, where there is a large population of minority ethnic Uyghurs.Refuge
In a borderless world, borders don't matter. Xinjiang's concerns have the sympathy of the neighbours who will help when the time comes.
