Muslim Uyghurs at it again in China | Freepress Journal
Beijing: Two policemen and nine militants have been killed when axe-wielding assailants attacked a police station in China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province, the latest in a series of deadly attacks amid heightened tension in the volatile western region bordering PoK.
Nine mobs holding knives and axes attacked a police station on Saturday in Serikbuya township near the historic Silk Road city of Kashgar, killing two auxiliary policemen and injuring another two policemen. The nine assailants, including one identified with an apparent Uyghur name as Abla Ehet, were gunned down on the site, located close to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Xinjiang, where Muslim Uyghurs make up a large part of the population, has faced unrest between Uyghurs and members of China’s majority Han community over their increasing settlements in the province.
