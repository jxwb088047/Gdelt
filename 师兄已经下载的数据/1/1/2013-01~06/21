China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region will beef up crackdown on terrorism in order to preserve social stability, said Zhang Chunxian, Party chief of Xinjiang, at a conference on Friday night, Xinjiang Daily reported.
The pledge came after the June 26 terrorist attack in Shanshan county that killed at least 27, and a large gathering in Hetian county on June 28.
President Xi Jinping and other top leaders have ordered maintaining social order in Xinjiang following the two incidents.
The two incidents have been handled appropriately and in a timely manner, and the whole region is now stable, said Zhang.
Local governments should put more energy into working with the public in fighting terrorism, he added.
