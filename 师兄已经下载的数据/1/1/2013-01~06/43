China knife attack: 27 dead in 'riots', Muslim strains with Han Chinese | Examiner.com
A China knife attack has brought warring conflicts between different ethnic groups to the forefront this week, as UPI reported this Thursday, June 27, that that an estimated 27 people were killed in a bloody riot in western China on Wednesday morning. A conflict between Uighur Muslim groups and the Han Chinese is believed to be the possible source of the violence.
The China knife attack is believed to be the deadliest occurrence of ethnic-related violence since a 2009 attack that left over 200 people dead. In addition to the 27 people killed — including 9 police officers, several civilians, and other victims in the brawl — three people were said to be critically injured from stabbing knife wounds.
Following the sudden attack, police officers arrived on scene and shot down the 10 alleged attackers.
Only limited details on the China knife attack have become available through Xinhua News Agency; other details have not been revealed at this point in time.
It was the population of Uighur Muslims and their strained relationships with the Han Chinese in western China that may have contributed to the fatal attack. While the Muslims allegedly argue that the Chinese force “repression and force provocation” upon them, the Han Chinese in turn were reported to blame opposing activities for using violent force rather than words to deal with matters.
