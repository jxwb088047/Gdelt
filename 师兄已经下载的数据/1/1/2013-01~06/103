China hunting family members of Xinjiang bombers - bdnews24.com
The Chinese government has blamed religious extremists 
for carrying out a bomb and knife attack at a train station in Urumqi, regional 
capital of Xinjiang, on Wednesday evening that killed one bystander and wounded 
79.Both attackers were killed in the blast, according to the government. 
In an embarrassing security lapse, the attack happened just as President Xi 
Jinping was wrapping up his first visit to Xinjiang since becoming president 
last year.The newspaper identified one of the attackers as Sedirdin 
Sawut, a 39-year-old man from Xayar county in Xinjiang's Aksu region. The man is 
a member of the Muslim Uighur minority, judging by his name.The Global 
Times, an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official 
People's Daily, said police are now looking for Sawut's wife, father, two 
cousins and his father-in-law, who seem to have gone missing after the 
attack.They are all suspected of helping Sawut in the attack, the 
newspaper said, citing anonymous Xinjiang police officers.Police are 
also looking for two other men who may have been involved in making the bombs, 
both of whom knew Sawut and also come from the same county, the report 
added.Resource-rich and strategically located Xinjiang, on the borders 
of central Asia, has for years been beset by violence blamed by the Chinese 
government on Islamist militants and separatists, but suicide attacks have been 
extremely rare.There have been suicide bombings before in China, mostly 
by people with personal grievances, but it has generally not been a tactic 
employed by Uighurs."Previously the attackers would try to leave after 
they planted the bomb. This time they obviously stayed to be killed," the 
newspaper quoted another unnamed security official as saying.In October, 
a car ploughed into tourists on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing 
the car's three occupants and two bystanders, in what the government believed 
was a suicide attack by people from Xinjiang.Exiles and many rights 
groups say the real cause of the unrest in Xinjiang is China's heavy-handed 
policies, including curbs on Islam and the culture and language of the Uighur 
people.Unrest in Xinjiang has caused the deaths of more than 100 people 
in the past year, prompting a tougher stance against the Turkic-language 
speaking Uighurs, many of whom resent government controls on their culture and 
religion.In March, 29 people were stabbed to death in the southwestern 
city of Kunming, far from Xinjiang and on the borders of Southeast Asia. The 
government blamed that attack on Xinjiang extremists.
