Official stresses tightened measures against terror attacks - Xinhua | English.news.cn
URUMQI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official stressed Sunday that the government will tighten overall measures to strike hard on violent terrorist crimes in Xinjiang in order to safeguard social stability and the interest of people of all ethnic groups.
Meng Jianzhu, secretary of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks during visits to the police and armed police in cities of Aksu and Hotan in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
Xinjiang was hit by violent terrorist attacks in the past few days, in which at least 24 innocent civilians and police officers were killed.
During visits to a police station and city square in Hotan and the Aksu railway station, Meng praised police and armed police for their contribution to stability and ethnic unity in Xinjiang.
Meng urged them to fully implement the instructions from a recent meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, which asked to severely crack down terrorist crimes.
The atrocity of terrorists in Xinjiang outraged the entire nation, and the riots are the enemy of people in Xinjiang, and all the people nationwide, he said.
At the commanding center of Hotan city bureau of public security, Meng and Guo Shengkun, minister of public security, watched an exercise of examining and stopping suspected cars. They also visited a commercial pedestrian street in Aksu to learn about community-based security patrols.
