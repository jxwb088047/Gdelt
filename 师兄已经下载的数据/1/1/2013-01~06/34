25 Years After Tiananmen Square, Blank Memories, Muffled Voices in China - US News
A Chinese couple walks past Tiananmen Square Monday, 25 years after the deadly crackdown against the pro-democracy movement.
The 1989 protests began in mid-April of that year and spread elsewhere in China. The pro-democracy movement swelled until an estimated 1 million students and workers descended on the streets of Beijing in a fit of revolution, angered by what they perceived as corruption and cronyism plaguing the Chinese government. Their plight caught worldwide attention through the unusually broad international media presence covering Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit around the same time. Chinese leaders responded by declaring martial law and eventually turning the People’s Liberation Army against its own. As many as 3,700 people died as a result, according to U.S. government estimates. Thousands were questioned and jailed.
Today, the historic protests and violent response remain sensitive issues for the Chinese Communist Party amid the country’s well-publicized desires to become a greater world power.
"It's something the party has tried to erase from history," Saunders says. "The fact that it is still a taboo subject inside China shows just how powerful the potential impact is."  
The Chinese government has refused to acknowledge the protests as anything short of attempted insurrection, and any memorials or other forms of remembrance are officially banned. Mentions of the square in Chinese state media have been linked to its description as a tourist attraction for many of China’s diverse ethnic groups and used as a symbol of the nation’s growing civic maturity.
A Jan. 1 article in China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency highlights a commemoration there marking the dawn of 2014. A Friday feature told of a child born in the “Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region” who was able to stand in Tiananmen – which translates to “Gate of Heavenly Peace” – and watch a flag-raising ceremony thanks to the help of an industrious student fundraiser.
Backing up Beijing’s enforced ignorance stands an increasingly strong national security apparatus, which in the last 25 years has diversified and better prepared itself to quell anti-government sentiment. The effort to shut down an alliance of students and workers fighting for democratic rights has morphed into a militant counterterrorism effort that spans the massive nation, responding to or anticipating civic dissent.
This transformation coincides, at least in part, with a form of dissent in China that’s no longer peaceful: Attacks blamed on ethnic Uighur separatists regularly make headline news in China, with insurgents even striking at Tiananmen Gate in Beijing last year.
Other government critics – such as artist Ai Weiwei and Tibetan activists intent on regaining independence for the annexed region – face censorship, harassment and arrest despite more peaceful means of protest. And any progress toward government reform has been slow at best.
“Despite widespread acknowledgment that loosened restrictions on society to encourage public participation, lessening state control over the economy, and enforcing the rule of law are essential to China’s economic development, China continues to pursue economic modernization without political reform or guarantees to fundamental human rights,” the 2013 Congressional-Executive Commission on China report states.  
Internal security has remained a central focus of the Chinese government under the new leadership of President Xi Jinping. The Communist Party recently announced the creation of a new national security commission and granted Xi authority to run it. In May alone, police in three Chinese prefectures made more than 200 arrests involving supposed extremists and terrorists, seized more than 200 explosive devices and cracked down on at least 24 extremist groups, according to Xinhua.
While public dissent may have become increasingly difficult since Tiananmen, the Chinese people have no shortage of gripes. Massive deficits of medicine and food, along with serious environmental concerns continue to plague the country. Air pollution has accounted for a 5.5-year decrease in the life expectancy in northern China, and environmental issues have cost China roughly 9 percent of its gross national income. China has begun investing in food suppliers in the U.S. and places like Ukraine to offset shortages at home, in a market becoming increasingly reliant on imports to keep its people fed.
Still, a form of “yuppieism” appears to have taken over for younger Chinese citizens, as the first generation of workers born after the original protests fixes its concern on issues related to jobs, their children and supporting their parents. As few as 15 out of 100 students at four of Beijing’s top colleges last year could identify the iconic “Tank Man” imagery from the 1989 protests, according to USA Today and NPR correspondent Louisa Lim.
"For younger people, the entire record of the Tiananmen massacre has been suppressed or wiped out by the Communist Party," says Larry Wortzel, a congressionally appointed member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. "The party will lock you up if you do anything to memorialize the event."
"Communist Party leaders clearly realize the importance of what they did on June 4, 1989,” he says. “That is why the CCP works hard to put people in custody who may want to protest the massacre.”
The government's efforts to squash all discussion of the issue also has spread to Chinese communities elsewhere. Gene Schamko, a pastor at the Chinese Christian Church of Greater Washington D.C., says he had to remind at least one member of his congregation of this week's anniversary, even though she had lived in China at the time. There also were members concerned by his previous effort to bring a Tiananmen protest participant to speak to the congregation. 
"Some of the people at the church had a problem because they saw it as a political thing, rather than purely spiritual," he says. 
The Chinese Communist Party and its paramilitary wings additionally have become much more creative in efforts to create unity and stifle dissent. Chinese farmers, for example, upset by an unannounced rezoning of their land, are now paid off to prevent organized protests, keeping the problem a regional one.
Both sides of the 1989 demonstrations learned a lot about the other – none more than the Chinese people witnessing how far their government was willing to go in order to maintain peace.
But the real key to peace and lasting government control in the country may be whether China can ever rectify its revolutionary history with its present worldly aims.
