China 'terrorists' riot in latest Xinjiang clash: Report
BEIJING - China's state-run media on Saturday blamed around 100 people it branded as "terrorists" for sparking 'riots' in the ethnically-divided region of Xinjiang, where clashes killed 35 days earlier.
The riot took place in the prefecture of Hotan on Friday, where the group "(attacked) a number of people with weapons after gathering at local religious venues," the state-run Global Times said on Saturday.
The latest incident followed clashes on Wednesday that were the deadliest to hit the western desert region - home to around 10 million members of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority - since 2009, when riots killed around 200 people.
Radio Free Asia, which is funded by the US government, quoted a resident as saying that local Uighurs were angry police had "stormed into the mosque and surrounded it" during prayers last week because the local imam had deviated from an officially sanctioned sermon.
It also quoted a source as saying police opened fire on Uighurs as they left a local mosque.
"Young Uighurs on motorcycles were leaving the mosque, they were shouting religious slogans...The police were frightened and started shooting at them ... At least two died and one was injured," the report said.
A state-run news website, Tianshan Web, said that no members of the public had been killed or injured, without stating whether police or government staff had died.
China's President Xi Jinping said following the attacks that "(the incidents) must be handled quickly to guarantee the general stability of the society," Tianshan Web reported on Saturday.
