Two die in Xinjiang clashes - Newspaper - DAWN.COM
URUMQI (China), June 29: China’s state-run media blamed on Saturday over 100 people it branded “terrorists” for sparking “riots” in the ethnically-divided region of Xinjiang, where days earlier clashes killed 35.
The latest unrest took place in the prefecture of Hotan on Friday, where the group “(attacked) a number of people with weapons after gathering at local religious venues,” the state-run Global Times said on Saturday.
Radio Free Asia quoted a resident as saying that local Uighurs were angry police had “stormed into the mosque and surrounded it” during prayers last week because the local imam had deviated from an officially sanctioned sermon. Police opened fire on Uighurs as they left a local mosque.
“Young Uighurs on motorcycles were leaving the mosque, they were shouting religious slogans...The police were frightened and started shooting at them ... At least two died and one was injured,” the report said.—AFP
