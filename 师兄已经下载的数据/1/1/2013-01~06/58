Security crackdown in China's far western Xinjiang region - Australia Network News - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)
A huge military build-up is being reported around China's ethnically divided Xinjiang region where clashes over the past few days claimed 35 lives.
China's state media is calling the military build-up a 'drill', involving tanks, military vehicles and armed personnel who blocked streets to the capital Urumqi.
An AFP reporter at the scene says a large section of the city was shut down during the exercise.
Beijing sent two high-ranking officials to the far western region on Saturday after a top level Communist Party meeting headed by President Xi Jinping.
"We will step up actions to crack down upon terrorist groups and extremist organisations and track the wanted," a member of the party's Politburo Standing Committee, Yu Zhengsheng, said after arriving in Urumqi, Xinhua news agency reported.
The drill came ahead of the fourth anniversary of riots in Urumqi between members of China's mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority and its Han majority, which left around 200 dead.
A senior member of the Chinese Communist Party has called for 24 hour patrols in the area.
Rights groups for the mostly Muslim Uighur minority deny state claims that outbreaks of unrest in the region are terrorism, instead blaming unrest on economic inequality and religious repression.
Military vehicles and at least 1,000 personnel from the People's Armed Police, part of China's armed forces responsible for law enforcement and internal security during peacetime, were deployed in Urumqi.
State run media described the exercises as "ceremonies... to support the fight against terrorism".
Information about unrest in Xinjiang is restricted by the Chinese government.
